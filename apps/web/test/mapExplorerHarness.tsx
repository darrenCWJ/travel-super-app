 * reason these tests ever needed a timeout budget at all. Under full-suite
 * parallel load it stretched past Testing Library's polling window and failed
 * as "Unable to find role=…" — which reads like a missing element rather than
 * a slow one, and sent two rounds of fixes at the timeout instead.
 *
 * Raising a budget only moves the threshold; the test still races the machine,
 * and the next busy CI box moves it back. Resolving the components up front
 * removes the race outright: both are imported once, here, and `dynamic()`
 * hands the right one straight back, so nothing in the files that import
 * this harness suspends and no assertion depends on how loaded the CPU is.
 *
 * A previous version of this mock said exactly that and then did the opposite.
 * Extended to tell the two renderers apart, it began returning a wrapper that
 * started at `useState(null)`, ran the loader in an effect and rendered
 * nothing until the promise landed — which is precisely the deferral the mock
 * exists to delete, reintroduced under a docblock claiming it was gone. That
 * is how the wall clock got back in, and the symptom was then treated as a
 * budget problem twice over. Anything added here must hand a component back
 * *synchronously*.
 *
 * Dispatch reads the loader's own source, which survives Vite's transform as
 * `__vite_ssr_dynamic_import__("/components/map/GlobeLevel.tsx").then((m) =>
 * m.GlobeLevel)` — the component's name appears whether or not the specifier
 * is rewritten. It throws rather than guessing when a loader matches neither
 * name or both: with two dynamic imports, a mock that quietly fell back to one
 * of them would render the flat map in the globe's place and every globe
 * assertion in the files that import this harness would pass against the
 * wrong component.
 *
 * What is given up is coverage of the `loading` fallback, which no test in

 * work (jsdom plus d3-geo projection) rather than anything that waits. That
 * is comfortably inside the budget on an idle machine and can fall outside
 * it when the full suite has every core busy, which is exactly the shape
 * of the flake: it never reproduced on those files alone, only in a full
 * run. Nothing here was ever slow to *settle* — it was slow to *compute*,
 * and a poll timeout cannot tell those apart, so it reported "Unable to
 * find role=…" as though the element were missing.
 *
 * The "~165ms" this note used to quote for that mount was measured off the
 * first test that calls it, and was mostly not the mount: the bulk of it was
 * the one-time jsdom environment warmup that every file's first role query
 * used to pay, which now happens in vitest.setup.ts instead. Removing it
 * from this file takes the first test from ~347ms to ~164ms. The sibling
 * tests that mount and settle the same world level land at ~35-45ms; the
 * first test stays longer than they do because it also pays React's first
 * render and the world renderer's first module evaluation, neither of which
 * the setup warmup covers.
 *
 * Draining to a fixed point removes the clock from the assertion entirely. The
 * work still takes however long it takes; the test simply waits for it rather
 * than racing it. vitest's own testTimeout stays as the backstop for a genuine
 * hang, which is the only thing a timeout should be catching.
