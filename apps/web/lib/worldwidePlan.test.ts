/**
 * T30 — the Peru acceptance gate, node half.
 *
 * The phase's original acceptance criterion, verbatim: *"A user picks Peru on
 * the globe, sees Peruvian cities, taps one, and it appears in their plan with
 * day counts and a route leg."* Every layer under that sentence has its own
 * suite. What has never been tested is the whole flow in one go, which is what
 * this file does: one Peru trip assembled through the same functions
 * `/api/trips` runs, serialised, and scanned in both directions.
 *
 * **Three assertions, and each closes a hole the other two leave open.**
 *
 * 1. **Negative** — nothing Chinese reached a Peru plan. This is what the whole
 *    phase was for.
 * 2. **Positive** — the plan is not merely *empty*. Deleting every generator's
 *    output would pass the negative half; the positive half is what stops that.
 *    A one-directional scan is this repo's single most common hollow-test shape.
 * 3. **Arming** — the identical scan, over a real *China* plan built by the same
 *    functions, reports leaks. A token list with a typo in it, a regex that
 *    never compiles, a scan handed an empty string: each matches nothing and
 *    passes forever. Nothing but the arming proof can tell those apart from a
 *    genuinely clean Peru plan.
 *
 * **Every input is real.** City ids and coordinates come from the committed
 * `public/cities/PE.json` and resolve through `data/cities-index.json`; the
 * airports are the rows `data/airports.json` ships; the facts behind every
 * Peruvian sentence are `data/country-facts.json`'s `PE` record. Nothing here
 * is a fixture, because "a Peru plan says nothing Chinese" measured against an
 * invented Peru would be worth nothing.
 *
 * **Everything expensive is built once, at module scope.** Resolving a GeoNames
 * city parses a 58,742-row index and the airport artifact is 877 KB; done
 * inside a `test`, that work is charged to that test's wall-clock budget and
 * makes it flake under parallel load (see commit 84cd61e). Collection carries
 * no per-test timeout, so each `test` below is a string scan and nothing else.
 */

 * resolves through `data/cities-index.json` server-side, which is the path a
 * real trip takes: the wizard sends ids, `resolveDestinations` turns them into
 * `Destination`s. Three cities rather than one so the plan contains hops, which
 * is where `hopTitle` and `hopNote` — China's most quotable leak — would land.
