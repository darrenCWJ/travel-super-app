/**
 * next.config.ts lives at the repo root, not under lib/ — this file sits here
 * anyway because lib/ is the only place vitest.config.mts's node project globs
 * for `.test.ts` files, and `nextConfig.headers()` is a plain async function
 * returning a plain array, so it needs no Next server to call. `lib/proxy.test.ts`
 * already imports a repo-root module (`@/proxy`) for exactly this reason.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: before it, NOTHING in the repo imported
 * next.config.ts and CI runs no `next build`, so every plausible mutation of
 * the `/cities/` cache rule — deleting it, misspelling the header key, zeroing
 * max-age, narrowing `:path+` to `:path`, reverting to the old single-segment
 * inline regex — passed `tsc --noEmit && npm test` untouched. That silence
 * matters more than a cache header usually would: `lib/cityShard.ts`'s
 * `fetchCityShard` deliberately keeps NO module-level cache because it relies
 * on this header, so a regression here has no in-memory fallback — it quietly
 * reinstates a full refetch on every country switch.
 *
 * Two halves, and both are needed. The literal assertions pin the source string
 * and the exact header pair. The compiled-matcher assertions pin what that
 * source actually MEANS, using Next's own vendored path matcher — the same
 * `getPathMatch` its custom-route layer compiles `headers()` sources with — so
 * a syntactically valid but semantically wrong pattern cannot slip through.
