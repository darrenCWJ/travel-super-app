/**
 * Gates for the Task 33 re-tokenisation sweep — the PR3 enabler.
 *
 * PR3 deleted the `@theme` block that used to duplicate part of the palette in
 * `app/globals.css`. Nothing in TypeScript or React can notice a consumer of
 * that deleted block: a Tailwind utility whose colour no longer exists still
 * compiles, still renders, and simply comes out unstyled. `tsc` is blind to it
 * and so is every component test. These scans are the only place a missed
 * consumer can fail loudly, so they are deliberately blunt and read source as
 * text — and they stay in place as a permanent guard, not just a one-time
 * migration check.
 *
 * Three separate risks, three separate gates:
 *  1. a surviving consumer of the retired palette (would have broken on PR3's
 *     deletion, and would break again if the block ever came back);
 *  2. a *typo'd* token — `var(--ink-9)` is valid CSS, so it compiles happily and
 *     paints nothing;
 *  3. an arbitrary value Tailwind cannot parse, which silently emits no rule.

 * `--paper` is the fix rather than a new token for the same reason it was in
 * Task 39: it inverts in lockstep with the band, and its light value *is*
 * `#ffffff`, so the swap is free in light and repairs dark.
 *
 * Translucent `bg-white/NN` is deliberately still allowed. A 15% wash lightens
 * whatever it sits on in *either* ramp, so the pill chips in `PlanStep` and
