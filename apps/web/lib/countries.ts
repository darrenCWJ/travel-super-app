/**
 * The English name of every country `CURATED` above does not name.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT HAND-MAINTAINED — the same shape, and for the same reason, as
 * `SOUTHERN` below. Every entry is the `name` field of that country's record in
 * `data/country-facts.json`, the CC0 Wikidata artifact, and
 * `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`'s `INGESTED_NAMES cross-check` re-derives this
 * table from it on every run in BOTH directions: a code here whose name differs
 * from the artifact's fails, and a country the artifact names that is missing
 * from here fails too. Regenerating after an ingest is a one-liner over the
 * artifact's `name` fields; the test names every code that moved.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES. `getCountry(code).name` fell back to the bare code, so the
 * map pane's heading, its "← Back to …" control, the destination step's
 * country chip and its empty state all read **GA** rather than **Gabon** — for
 * 222 of the 246 countries this app now opens, which is to say for everywhere
 * except the 24 somebody hand-tuned. The name was never missing; it was in an
 * artifact this module is forbidden to read.
 *
 * IT IS A LITERAL RATHER THAN A LOOKUP, and that is a bundle constraint, not an
 * oversight. This module is a zero-import leaf, pinned as one by
 * `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`, whose own comment names *this exact defect* and
 * the tempting fix for it: "The tempting fix for `getCountry("PE").name ===
 * "PE"` is to make THIS module fall back to the artifact." It is 70 KB and this
 * module is imported by client components for accents, marks and hemispheres,
 * so that fix would put the whole artifact into every page that wants a hue —
 * and `MUST_STAY_CHEAP` in that file forbids it outright for
 * components/map/MapExplorer.tsx, which is where the bare codes were being
 * drawn. The 222 names are 4.1 KB. The derivation therefore happens in the
 * test, which runs on every commit and has no bundle to pay for, and the answer
 * is checked in.
 *
 * THE CURATED TABLE STILL WINS, and this table does not contain the codes it
 * covers, so the precedence is structural rather than a rule in `getCountry`
 * that could be reordered. The two disagree on purpose where both would have an
 * answer: `CN` is "China" here and "People's Republic of China" upstream, `TR`
 * is "Türkiye" and "Turkey". Those 24 rows are editorial, they are what the app
 * already calls those countries everywhere else, and an ingest must never
 * overwrite them — the same precedence `getCountryName` in lib/countryFacts.ts
 * applies to the artifact, so the two resolvers cannot disagree about any code.

/**
 * The English name of every country neither table above names.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT HAND-PICKED, and it is derived by subtraction rather than from a
 * field: it is exactly `ISO_NUMERIC_TO_ALPHA2` minus `CURATED` minus every code
 * `data/country-facts.json` names. `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`'s
 * `UNINGESTED_NAMES cross-check` recomputes that subtraction from the two files
 * on every run and compares it to these keys in BOTH directions, so the table
 * cannot gain a row that something else already names, and cannot miss one that
 * nothing does. Four codes fall out today: 250 codes in the ISO table, 246
 * named by the artifact, and the 24 `CURATED` names are all inside those 246.
 *
 * ALL FOUR ARE UNINHABITED, which is why the artifact has no record of them —
 * the ingest is bounded to sovereign states with a population, so Antarctica,
 * Bouvet Island, Heard & McDonald and the US Minor Outlying Islands were never
 * candidates. `SOUTHERN` below already carries three of them for the same
 * reason and says so at length; this is that exception applied to the name.
 *
 * WHAT IT FIXES. `getCountry("AQ").name` was `"AQ"`, so opening Antarctica
 * titled the map pane **AQ**, made its control read "← Back to AQ" and put
 * **AQ** on the destination step's country chip — while the world map right
 * beside them said *Antarctica*, because `countryLabel` in
 * components/map/worldLevelShared.tsx fell back to the topology's name when
 * `getCountry` handed back the bare code. Three resolvers, two answers, for the
 * two codes a user can actually reach this way: AQ and HM both have a drawable
 * feature in `public/world-countries.json` and are not in `SEARCH_ONLY`. HM
 * gains more than a fix — the map called it Natural Earth's abbreviated "Heard
 * I. and McDonald Is." and now calls it what everything else does.
 *
 * THE NAMES ARE THE ISO 3166-1 ENGLISH SHORT NAMES, which is the same register
 * as the artifact's and therefore the register the other 246 are already in.
 *
 * THE ARTIFACT STILL WINS where it has an answer, and this table does not
 * contain a code it names, so the precedence is structural rather than a rule
 * in `getCountry` that could be reordered. `getCountryName` in
 * lib/countryFacts.ts consults this last for the same reason: the day an ingest
 * gains a record for one of these, that record speaks and the cross-check fails
 * until the row here is deleted. The exception removes itself.

/**
 * Southern-hemisphere countries, which invert the seasons.
 *
 * DERIVED, NOT HAND-MAINTAINED. Every code here is a country whose centroid
 * latitude in `data/country-facts.json` is negative, plus the named
 * straddlers below. The artifact has carried a `lat` for all 246 countries
 * since the country-facts ingest landed, and
 * `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`'s `SOUTHERN cross-check` re-derives this set from
 * it in BOTH directions on every run: a code listed here whose centroid is not
 * negative fails, and a country whose centroid IS negative and is missing from
 * here fails too.
 *
 * The second direction is the one that was missing. This list was hand-written
 * when no centroid data existed in the repo, the check that arrived later only
 * ever walked the list, and the list had 33 of the 58 negative-latitude
 * countries — 34 entries, of which KE is the straddler below rather than one of
 * the 58 — so Ecuador, Gabon, Mauritius, the Falklands, the Comoros and 20
 * others were told a June trip was summer when it is winter. A one-directional
 * check cannot see a missing entry; that is why the reconciliation is
 * bidirectional and why this comment says derived rather than curated.
 *
 * IT IS A LITERAL RATHER THAN A LOOKUP, and that is a bundle constraint, not
 * an oversight. This module is a zero-import leaf, pinned as one by
 * `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`, because client components import it for accents,
 * marks and hemispheres; `data/country-facts.json` is 70 KB, so reading the
 * latitudes here at runtime would put the whole artifact into every page that
 * wants a hue. The derivation therefore happens in the test, which runs on
 * every commit and has no bundle to pay for, and the answer is checked in.
 * Regenerating after an ingest is a one-liner over the artifact's `lat`
 * fields; the test tells you exactly which codes moved.
 *
 * TWO JUDGEMENTS SIT ON TOP OF THE SIGN, both named rather than rounded:
 *
 * - KE (+0.1) is listed although its centroid is north of the equator. Kenya
 *   straddles it, and Nairobi, the Mara and the coast — everywhere a visitor
 *   goes — are south of it, so its travel season is the southern one. It is
 *   the sole entry on `EQUATOR_STRADDLERS` in the cross-check, which fails if
 *   Wikidata ever moves the centroid south and makes the exception cruft.
 * - CG (-0.75), EC (-1.0), GA (-0.68) and NR (-0.53) are listed on the sign
 *   alone, and NO THRESHOLD EXCLUDES THEM. Within a degree of the equator
 *   neither hemisphere's seasons mean anything — these places have wet and dry
 *   seasons, not summer and winter — and this app has only two answers to
 *   give. Rounding them to "north" would be picking the wrong one of two wrong
 *   answers and hiding the choice in a magic number; the sign is at least the
 *   one the data states. Naming them here is the honest version of that.
 *   ST (+0.32) is the same call on the other side of the line, and it is named
 *   for the same reason: it is closer to the equator than Congo or Gabon, it is
 *   NOT listed here, and that is a decision rather than an oversight. The
 *   cross-check now scans both signs, so it is a country somebody looked at.
 *
 * THREE CODES ARE LISTED THAT THE ARTIFACT DOES NOT COVER: AQ, BV and HM. They
 * are Antarctica, Bouvet Island and Heard & McDonald Islands — uninhabited, so
 * the sovereign-state ingest has no record for them and every code above got
 * its sign from a centroid these three have none of. Left off, `getCountry`
 * fell through to its default and reported Antarctica's January as WINTER. That
 * is not a close call the way a country at -0.5 is: AQ's every square metre is
 * south of 60°S, BV sits at -54.4 and HM at -53.1, and the app draws two of the
 * three on the world map — BV has no 50m feature and is in `SEARCH_ONLY`, which
 * reaches it by search instead. They are the sole entries of
 * `OUTSIDE_THE_ARTIFACT` in the cross-check, which fails the day any of them
 * gains a record — at which point the sign rule covers them and the exception
 * is deleted. `UNINGESTED_NAMES` above is these three plus UM, being the same
 * gap answered for a different field — the name. UM is absent HERE and present
 * THERE, which is the one difference between the two lists: it needs a name
 * like any other code, and it has never been listed as southern.
