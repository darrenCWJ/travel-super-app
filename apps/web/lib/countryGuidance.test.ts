/**
 * T21's gate: the generated plan stops being unconditionally Chinese.
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the one that is usually missing. The negative
 * half proves a Peru trip carries none of China's copy. On its own it would
 * also pass against a generator that emitted nothing at all, so the positive
 * half pins that the same fixture still produces a plan, a packing list and
 * tips — and pins the exact sentences, because three of the four leaks this
 * task closes contain no forbidden token:
 *
 *   "High-speed rail or flight to Cusco"
 *   "Arrive at the station 30–40 minutes early; passport needed to board."
 *   "Lip balm and moisturiser — northern air is very dry"
 *
 * A token scan alone reports all three as clean. That is the hollow half of
 * the task's own prescribed test story, and the explicit copy pins below are
 * the repair.
 *
 * The scan is also run against a China plan and asserted to *fail*, because a
 * scan that silently matches nothing looks exactly like a clean one.
