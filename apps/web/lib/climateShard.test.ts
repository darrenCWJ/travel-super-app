 * How far the COMMITTED climate artifact may lag `public/cities/`, per

 * accumulated since the last hand dispatch of `refresh-climate.yml`.
 *
 * The two artifacts are refreshed on different clocks, and what this bound
 * sizes is the CUMULATIVE gap between them, not any single night's edit.
 * `.github/workflows/refresh-cities.yml` runs NIGHTLY and rebuilds
 * `public/cities/` from GeoNames; `.github/workflows/refresh-climate.yml` is
 * dispatch-only, by hand — so every night the catalog moves and the climate
 * artifact does not, and the gap keeps widening until someone dispatches
 * that workflow. Measured over six nightly refreshes, 2026-08-28 to
 * 2026-09-03: +315 ids gained no climate row, −304 climate rows lost their
 * city. The churn persists rather than flapping back to zero — each
 * country's catalog caps at 750 cities, so a ranking swap that pushes one
 * city past that line stays pushed — at a steady rate of about 7 ids a
 * night, in each direction.
 *
 * Exact parity is not being given up; it is being asserted where it can hold.
 * `assertCityParity` in `scripts/climate/gate.mjs` runs before the first
 * write, so every dispatch restores exact parity and refresh-climate.yml's own
 * verify step always sees it on a tree that job just built. What cannot be
 * asserted here is exact parity on the committed artifact, because `npm test`
 * ALSO runs inside refresh-cities.yml's `commit` job, against the freshly
 * built city shards: an exact check there goes red the first night GeoNames
 * moves a single id, the nightly refresh then commits nothing, and dispatching
 * refresh-climate.yml cannot even recover it — the climate build samples the
 * COMMITTED city shards, so the catalog it needs has never landed.
 *
 * The lag is presentational and never wrong data: a city with no climate row
 * resolves to `NEUTRAL_FIT` (components/map/mapTypes.ts:231-233). So the
 * test below exists to catch a WHOLESALE mismatch — an artifact built
 * against a different catalog altogether, which misses essentially all
 * ~58,757 rows — and not accumulated churn. 10,000 per direction is about
 * 17% of the catalog: 5-6x under a wholesale mismatch, and roughly three to
 * four years of the measured ~7-a-night churn. A 1,000 bound would be
 * exhausted within a season — the six nights above alone would have spent
 * nearly a third of it — sending the nightly refresh red on ordinary churn,
 * not a real mismatch. When the nightly cities refresh trips this bound,
 * that failure is itself the cue to hand-dispatch `refresh-climate.yml`.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT asserted: that the drift is currently 0, which it is.
 * Pinning today's zero would recreate exactly the defect this bound removes.
