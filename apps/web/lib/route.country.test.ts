 * Peru, because it is the country the estimator was lying about.
 *
 * `lib/route.test.ts` is untouched by this task and stays that way: it pins the
 * China path, and the point of the optional `transport` parameter is that the
 * China path did not move. Everything here is the other side of that parameter.
 *
 * Every fixture is real. City coordinates are the ones the app ships in
 * `public/cities/PE.json`; the airports are the exact rows from
 * `data/airports.json`. Nothing below is a constructed meridian, because the
 * claim being tested — "there is no train from Lima to Cusco" — is about a real
 * place and would be worth nothing measured against an invented one.
