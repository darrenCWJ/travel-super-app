   * point. `logistics.tips` above is a *copy of a snapshot*: `plan.tips` was
   * frozen when the trip was created and is served back unchanged forever,
   * which is right for advice a traveller acted on. This is a statement about
   * our current coverage, so it is recomputed from `tripCountry(payload.data)`
   * every time a briefing is built — a briefing is a per-request view of the
   * trip, never persisted — and it shrinks as the facts artifact grows.
   *
   * Empty for China, which is researched by hand and has nothing to disclaim.
   *
   * Computed in this module rather than in `BriefingView` so the briefing
   * *renderer* stays free of the 70 KB facts artifact: `app/b/[code]/page.tsx`
   * is an unauthenticated server page that calls `buildBriefing` server-side,
   * and a client component resolving the note itself would ship those bytes to
   * every bearer-link holder. See `lib/countryFacts.test.ts`.

   * high-speed train over a Peruvian hop — and this is the surface it mattered
   * most on, because /b/[code] needs no login. The glyph is a claim about a
   * rail network, so it has to come from the country's `railKmh`; see
   * `travelEmoji`.
   *
   * Carried as a resolved string rather than as a country code or a rail speed
   * because `BriefingView` must not resolve it: it is a `"use client"`
   * component rendered by the unauthenticated page, and reaching a country
   * profile from there would ship the 70 KB facts artifact to every bearer-link
   * holder. `lib/countryFacts.test.ts` fails the build if it ever does. That is
   * the same split `gapNote` documents, and `Briefing` is a display view model
   * throughout — `BriefingBooking` is likewise "a ticket flattened for
   * display" — so a display-ready glyph is in keeping rather than an intrusion.
