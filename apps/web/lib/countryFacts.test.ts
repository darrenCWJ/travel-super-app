 * 2,092 before two of those six got their languages back from a curated row.
 * The artifact got smaller and then slightly larger again, which is what an
 * honest gap and an honest rescue each do to a budget.
 *
 * The design's prototype said 50,265 and said to re-measure rather than carry
 * it forward; the real figure is 40% larger, mostly because 239 countries
 * carry their official languages and `currencyName` ships beside every code.
 * Adding the country name cost 4,927 bytes — 1,440 gzipped — which is the
 * price of every gap note and every packing line naming a country instead of
 * a two-letter code.
 *
 * The budget matters because this file reaches the BROWSER —
 * components/PlanStep.tsx generates the wizard preview client-side, and
 * serving guidance server-only would reintroduce the preview/saved-trip
 * disagreement this whole work exists to fix. For scale:
 * data/country-images.json is 6,505 bytes and fine, and
 * lib/server/cityIndex.ts is 3.65 MB and explicitly forbidden from client
 * components. The budget STAYS at 80 KB rather than moving up with the
 * measurement: 12% of headroom is still room for real upstream growth and is
 * now much less room for a shape change, which is the direction a budget
 * should travel. The next field that costs 5 KB should have to argue for
 * itself here.
 *
 * NOT ASSERTED, and stated so it is not assumed: the gzipped size. It is
 * measured (10,295 bytes at zlib's default level) and recorded, and nothing
 * here or anywhere else in the repo checks it.

   *
   * This is the assertion whose ABSENCE let the defect stand. Until T28b the
   * root layout reached the artifact twice over — through TripAccentProvider,
   * which wanted one field off `data.input`, and through AppShell → ShareMenu
   * → lib/briefing.ts — and because the layout wraps every route, the 70 KB
   * shipped to /login, which no signed-in user has ever reached, and to
   * /b/[code], the unauthenticated bearer-link briefing. Every per-surface pin
   * above was true the whole time and none of them could see it: they ask which
   * SURFACES pay, and the layout is not a surface, it is the floor.
   *
   * Measured 2026-08-27: the layout's subtree fell from 41 modules to 18.
