 * The reader for `data/country-facts.json` — the CC0 Wikidata artifact the
 * ingest built and a human committed — and the one place a country NAME is

 *
 * Structured after lib/countryImagery.ts, deliberately and for the same two
 * reasons: the data is bundled by a static import rather than read from disk
 * (serverless deployments have no `data/` directory, and the wizard preview
 * generates client-side), and the file is a GENERATED artifact, so this module
 * is the only thing standing between an upstream shape change and a sentence
 * shown to a traveller.
 *
 * Two rules govern everything below.
 *
 * **The boundary drops, it never repairs.** A value that fails its shape check
 * is discarded, not coerced: `"220"` does not become `220`, `"pen"` does not
 * become `"PEN"`, `["A", "BB"]` does not become `["A"]`. Repairing invents
 * data, and a repaired fact is indistinguishable from a real one by the time
 * it reaches a template. Dropping produces the honest gap that
 * lib/countryTips.ts is built to name out loud, so a dropped record is never
 * silent — it surfaces as the gap note listing every field it lost.
 *
 * **Copy on read.** `countryProfile.test.ts:45-50` pins that a profile hands
 * out fresh objects whose arrays a caller may mutate without corrupting the
 * curated tables for everyone else. `COUNTRY_FACTS` is one shared object built
 * once at module load, so that contract survives only if every read copies.

/*
 * WHY THE MONEY TEMPLATES RENDER `currencyCode` AND NEVER `currencyName`.
 *
 * T25 measured it: Peru's committed `currencyName` is `"Nuevo sol"`, which is
 * the pre-2015 name — Peru dropped "nuevo" that year and the unit is now the
 * sol. So the artifact publishes a label that is simply wrong, and it publishes
 * 238 more that nobody has checked.
 *
 * RE-EXAMINED against the live endpoint on 2026-08-27, when the ingest gained
 * the country name and the question "is a correct currency name obtainable?"
 * had to be answered rather than assumed. It is not:
 *
 * - The `en`/`mul` COALESCE that rescued the euro does not help here. Q204656
 *   has an English label and no `mul` one, and that English label is
 *   `Nuevo sol`.
 * - `P1813` ("short name") is empty for every currency sampled (PEN, CNY, JPY,
 *   GBP, MXN, CHF), so there is no better property to switch to.
 * - The field is not even consistent about WHAT it names: JPY's label is `yen`
 *   and MXN's is `peso`, generic units rather than the Japanese yen or the
 *   Mexican peso. "Prices are in peso" is wrong in a different way from
 *   "Prices are in Nuevo sol", and no rule distinguishes them.
 *
 * So this stays carried, validated and unrendered.
 *
 * A one-country correction would fix the country we happened to look at and
 * leave the class untouched, which is the worse outcome: it makes the field
 * feel verified. An ISO 4217 code is a different kind of value — it is
 * validated by shape, it is stable by treaty, it is what `lib/money.ts` pivots
 * on, and it cannot go stale the way a name can. So `currencyName` joins `lat`
 * as a field this module carries and no template may read.
 *
 * `countryTips.test.ts` holds the line with a test that no template output for
 * any country contains that country's `currencyName`, armed with PE's known-
 * wrong `"Nuevo sol"` as its positive case. That is stronger than a comment,
 * because the day someone reaches for the nicer-reading label it goes red.

 * Hand-verified overrides, applied per field and winning over the artifact.

 * rule withheld — see `017468c`); those are repaired before the artifact is
 * written. This table is
 * the different escape hatch — it can override a value the artifact already
 * publishes, which the ingest's table structurally cannot, because a row there
 * whose field upstream supplies is judged *stale* and refuses the write.
 *
 * The one candidate found so far was Peru's stale `currencyName`, and the
 * answer was not a row here — see the block comment above. Correcting the one
 * country somebody checked would have made 238 unchecked labels look verified.
 *
 * The `CURATED_HEROES` precedent (lib/countryImagery.ts:69) governs the rules:
 * a row is written only when a human verified it, and every row passes through

 *   is `CURATED_HEROES`' and `CURATED_FACTS`' rule: a human-verified value
 *   beats an upstream one, per field.
 * - The artifact fills in the other 222. Before it, `getCountry("PE").name`
 *   was `"PE"` and the gap note read "We don't have PE-specific guidance…"

 * - `UNINGESTED_NAMES` fills in the four the artifact has no record of at all,

 *   AQ, BV, HM, UM — so the sovereign-state ingest never had them as

 *   from the ISO code table, so it holds no code either of the other two names

 *   order because it is the order that ages correctly: an ingest that later
 *   covers Antarctica speaks for it immediately, and the cross-check fails
 *   until the now-redundant row is deleted. Before this, `getCountry("AQ")`
 *   answered `"AQ"` and this answered `""`, while the world map beside them
 *   said "Antarctica" — three resolvers, two wrong.
 * - `""` when none of the three has an answer, which means the code is not a
 *   country: `getCountryName("🙂")` lands here. `buildGapNote` returns `[]` for
 *   a blank name rather than writing a note that cannot say whose data is
 *   missing, and `powerAdapterItem` returns null — so the empty string is a
 *   real answer here and never a rendered one. It is no longer where a real
 *   country lands, which is why AQ, BV, HM and UM now get the gap note every
 *   other factless country gets instead of a silently empty profile.
