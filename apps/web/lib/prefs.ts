 * reimplements the order and gets it wrong the same way every time — it

 * wins. `WorldMap`'s choropleth is the one intended exception and documents
 * itself as one: a fixed accent there would paint every country the same
 * colour and erase what the tint says. An exception has to be argued at its own
 * call site; the default is this function.
