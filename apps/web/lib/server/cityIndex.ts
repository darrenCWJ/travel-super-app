/**
 * Binds the bundled worldwide city index to a lookup the server can use.
 *
 * A static `import` rather than an `fs` read, for the reason
 * lib/server/catalog.ts and lib/server/airports.ts both document: serverless
 * deployments have a read-only filesystem and no data/ directory, so a path
 * read works locally and fails in production. `public/cities/*.json` is
 * emphatically NOT an option here — spec §3.2 makes that a hard constraint,
 * and this file is the reason it can be one.
 *
 * data/cities-index.json is 3,653,616 bytes (3.65 MB) against
 * data/airports.json's 877,293 — 4.16x. That is the same mechanism at four
 * times the size rather than a new one.
 *
 * Tuples rather than objects because every object shape measured costs more
 * for the same 58,742 rows. Re-serialising the committed rows with
 * JSON.stringify: an id-keyed map of the same fields, with the id not repeated
 * inside each value, is 5,885,812 bytes — 1.61x this file; an array of
 * six-field objects is 6,179,522; even single-letter keys with no envelope
 * only get down to 4,828,362. The payload is parsed once per cold start, so
 * that difference is paid per instance, not once.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-06, JSON.parse of the committed files, median of five: this
 * one 22.6 ms, airports.json 2.5 ms, catalog.json 1.1 ms — about 27 ms per
 * cold instance for the three. That is why they stay static imports rather
 * than runtime reads: a file the function bundle does not carry answers 500,
 * and 27 ms is not worth that risk.
 *
 * Server-only, and enforced: `server-only` above makes a client import a
 * `next build` error rather than a silent 3.65 MB in the browser bundle.
 * Vitest aliases the package to an empty module (vitest.server-only.ts). The
 * client's side of the same data is a single country shard out of
 * public/cities/ — median 12 KB, 97 KB at the largest — parsed by
 * lib/cityShard.ts.
