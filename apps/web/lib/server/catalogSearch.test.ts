/**
 * The two country-scoped readers of the Wikidata catalog: `searchCities`, the
 * server leg of place search, and `mapCities`, the server leg of the map's
 * markers. One fixture for both, because they take the same country argument
 * and answer from the same corpus — and because a second fixture would be a
 * second `CIP_CATALOG_PATH` override racing this one's cache.
 *
 * A fixture rather than the real catalog: the point is which *spellings* match
 * and which *countries* are in scope, and stating the corpus in the test is
 * what makes an empty result mean something. Pointed at through
 * `CIP_CATALOG_PATH`, the same override `CIP_DB_PATH` gives the store.
 *
 * Fixture invariant (spec §6): the corpus contains cities in MORE THAN ONE
 * country. Stating `country` on every row is not enough on its own — the read
 * boundary fills `"CN"` anyway, so an all-China fixture is satisfied by an
 * implementation that answers `[]` for every country but CN, which is not
 * scoping at all. The two Peruvian rows are what make the scoping assertions
 * mean something.
