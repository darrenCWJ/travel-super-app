/**
 * Enrichment for a city nobody pre-fetched.
 *
 * `scripts/enrich-cities.mjs` gives the top 30 per country a description and
 * an image at build time — 6,244 of 58,742, of which 5,118 came back with
 * something. This is what the rest get, on first selection, cached by id for
 * the life of the server instance (spec §4).
 *
 * The predicate comes from `lib/geoNamesId.ts` and NOT from
 * `lib/server/cityIndex.ts`, which re-exports the same function: that file
 * static-imports the 3,653,616-byte `data/cities-index.json`, and nothing here
 * ever resolves a city, so importing the predicate from there would drag the
 * whole artifact into a bundle that wants a regex.
 *
 * The query is a re-implementation of the build script's rather than an import
 * of it: pulling a `scripts/*.mjs` into the Next server bundle would ship a
 * build tool to production. The two are small, and the pair of tests that pin
 * "bare id, P1566" sit on both sides.
 *
 * The record this returns is a BARE `Record<string, CityEnrichmentRecord>`,
 * deliberately not the `{ country, generatedAt, source, cities: {…} }`
 * envelope that `scripts/enrich-cities.mjs` writes to
 * `public/cities/enrich/<CC>.json`. `parseCityEnrichment` in lib/cityShard.ts
 * reads that envelope and returns `{}` for anything else without complaining,
 * so nothing here may be routed through it.
 *
 * Additive by design. Every failure path here resolves to whatever it has
 * rather than rejecting, because a city with no enrichment renders exactly as
 * a thin catalog city does today.
 *
 * Server-only, and enforced: `server-only` above makes a client import a
 * `next build` error rather than a Wikidata query sent from the browser,
 * where `USER_AGENT` below would not reliably reach the wire. The Fetch
 * Standard no longer forbids the header, but Chromium still drops a
 * script-set User-Agent without an error (crbug.com/571722), so the contact
 * information Wikimedia's policy requires would vanish with every test still
 * green: the test that pins it reads the arguments a stubbed `fetch`
 * receives, and the drop happens below that. Vitest aliases the package to
 * an empty module (vitest.server-only.ts).

 * both bound a single request, not how many requests one caller may make.
 * Ids are validated, so there is no injection — but caching a miss by design
 * means an unbounded map would grow one entry per distinct id, forever, in a
 * lambda's memory. FIFO eviction: the working set is the cities in one trip,
 * orders of magnitude under the cap.
