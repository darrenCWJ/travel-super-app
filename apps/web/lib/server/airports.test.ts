   * The drift guard. There is no CI for this repo, and the refresh workflow
   * pushes straight to the default branch unattended — so the only gate a bad
   * daily refresh actually passes through is `assertSane` in
   * scripts/ingest-airports.mjs, which runs inside that workflow. These tests
   * are the local backstop: they run when a human types `npm test`, and catch
   * whatever `assertSane` doesn't. These four are among the busiest airports
   * on Earth and will not lose scheduled service or change code. TNA is here
   * because it is the airport whose absence prompted this work.
