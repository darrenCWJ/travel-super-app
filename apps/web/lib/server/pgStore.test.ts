 * deployment that is the whole of the latency: measured against the real store
 * with the database local, `getTrip`'s query WORK is 0.119 ms, while eight
 * sequential hops over a pooler at 30 ms RTT is 291 ms. Same queries, same
 * rows, 2,400x the wall clock — and none of it visible in a test that only
 * checks the returned shape.
 *
 * So this asserts the ISSUE ORDER rather than a duration: no timing, no
 * threshold to tune, and it fails for the one reason that matters. Sequential
 * code cannot have issued the eighth statement while the first is still
 * unresolved; parallel code cannot have failed to.
