 * Place names a curated destination already covers, keyed by country.
 *
 * One list, three readers, all three wired as of Task 14. `lib/server/catalog.ts`
 * filters the Wikidata catalog with it; `PlaceSearch` filters the open
 * country's GeoNames shard with it; `MapExplorer` filters the same shard again
 * for the map's markers. Two of the three run in the browser, which is why the
 * list lives in a client-safe leaf rather than inside lib/server/catalog.ts: a
 * server-only home would force the browser halves to keep a second copy, and a
 * second copy of the list is how the three answers drift apart.
 *
 * The names come out **folded** (`foldPlaceName`), so a caller tests membership
 * with a folded name and never with a raw one.
 *
 * Keyed by country now that the catalog is worldwide. "Dali" is a Chinese city
 * the curated set covers and could plausibly name a place somewhere else; a
 * global name blocklist would hide that other place with no way to notice.

  // Forward defence, not a description of today's shard. Measured against the
  // committed public/cities/CN.json (413 rows): of the 21 folded names this
  // module puts in the CN set, exactly three match a shard row — "qingdao",
  // "chongqing" and "dali" — and of the six below only "Dali" does. Guilin,
  // Yangshuo, Kunming, Lijiang and Zhangjiajie are all absent, because the
  // shard is China's top 750 of GeoNames cities500 by notability minus the
  // catalog duplicates, and they did not make that cut.
  //
  // The list stays whole anyway: refresh-cities.yml rebuilds every shard from
  // a fresh GeoNames dump nightly, and a name that misses the cut today can
  // make it tomorrow. The failure it prevents — a bare "Yangshuo" chip offered
  // beside the curated "Guilin & Yangshuo" card — costs one array entry to
  // hold open and needs a re-ingest to notice if it is dropped.
