 * The four season chips, with no months attached — see `seasonMonths` below.

 * `months` used to be a field here, and it was a northern-hemisphere calendar
 * stated as a fact to every country on earth: `spring` was "Mar – May" whether
 * the trip was to Japan or to Peru, where spring is Sep–Nov. It got *worse* as
 * this branch progressed rather than better. The commit before this one grew
 * `SOUTHERN` in lib/countries.ts from 34 codes to 59, so 25 more countries now
 * correctly resolve a June trip to **winter** — while this table went on
 * printing "Jun – Aug" beside the word Summer. A season whose name and whose
 * months contradict each other is worse than one that is merely wrong.
 *
 * The field is REMOVED rather than corrected, which is the move
 * `KIND_EMOJI.travel` makes further down for the same reason: a renderer that
 * reaches here for a season's months now gets a type error instead of getting
 * the northern hemisphere's. `seasonMonths` is the only way to obtain them and
 * it cannot be called without saying which hemisphere is being drawn.

 * read by map, plan and briefing bundles that want one emoji and one short
 * label. The month names and the season boundaries live in lib/months.ts,
 * which also carries China's climate tables, its crowd curve and its curated
 * highlights; an edge from here to there would put all of that into every
 * bundle that renders a season chip.
 *
 * The two columns are not free-floating strings. `lib/meta.test.ts` reconciles
 * them against `getCountryBaseProfile(code).seasonOfMonth` in both hemispheres
 * and in both directions — every month named for a season must resolve to that
 * season, and every month *not* named must not — so a month in the wrong
 * bucket fails on the commit that puts it there. The southern column is the
 * northern one six months away, which is exactly what `seasonIn` in
 * lib/countryBaseProfile.ts computes for a southern country.

/**
 * The glyph for a city-to-city hop — two of them, because one was a lie.
 *
 * `🚄` is not decoration. It is a claim that this country has a rail network worth
 * putting a traveller on, which is exactly the claim `TransportProfile.railKmh`
 * makes and exactly the one `railKmh: null` withholds — lib/countryBaseProfile.ts's
 * neutral profile spells out what that null buys: *"no rail leg, no rail glyph,
 * and no rail booking copy for any country nobody has researched a network
 * for."* The glyph was the one clause of that sentence nothing implemented, so
 * a Chinese high-speed train was drawn over "Travel to Cusco" on all three plan
 * surfaces, the unauthenticated /b/[code] briefing included.
 *
 * **The replacement is deliberately not `✈️`.** The glyph resolves per COUNTRY, not
 * per leg: a `ScheduledItem` carries no mode, and the plans already persisted in
 * every saved trip never will. A plane would therefore be the same unsourced
 * claim pointing the other way — a short hop in a rail-less country is an
 * `overland` leg in lib/route.ts, which is flown by nobody. `🧭` names the act of
 * moving between cities and no vehicle at all, which is exactly as much as the
 * neutral hop title ("Travel to {city}") already says. Per-leg glyphs do exist
 * where per-leg modes do — components/map/MapExplorer.tsx draws `leg.mode` — and
 * that is the right shape wherever a `RouteLeg` is in hand.
 *
 * A compass and not the more obvious `🧳`, because `🧳` is already the wizard's
 * travellers chip in components/PlanStep.tsx ("🧳 2 adults + 1 kid"): a hop row
 * and a party count drawn with the same glyph is a worse page, and it would
 * also make "the Peru surface shows the neutral glyph" true whether or not a
 * hop was ever drawn. The jsdom gate pins the glyph against the hop title for
 * that reason rather than merely asserting its presence.
 *
 * China is unaffected: `CN_RAIL_KMH` is 230, so `travelEmoji` returns the rail
 * glyph and CN's hop keeps the train beside "High-speed rail or flight to …".
