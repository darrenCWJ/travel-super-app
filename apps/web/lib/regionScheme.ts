/**
 * The third map level's identifier, and the per-country scheme that produces it.
 *
 * The app has had a region level since long before it had 246 countries, but
 * that level is China's and only China's: `zoomRegion` is a `ChinaRegion`, its
 * seven values are hard-coded, and every affordance for it is gated on the
 * country being CN. This module is what the rest of the world zooms through.
 *
 * ## Why `RegionId` is `string` and not `ChinaRegion`
 *
 * `tsconfig.json` sets `"strict": true` and does NOT set
 * `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`. Once a `Record<K, …>`'s key type widens,
 * `record[k]` still types as the value type — never `value | undefined` — and
 * the compiler says nothing. Two records are load-bearing and both dereference
 * immediately:
 *
 * - `lib/months.ts` `REGION_MONTHS: Record<ChinaRegion, RegionMonthClimate[]>`,
 *   read as `REGION_MONTHS[region][month - 1]`. A non-China key yields
 *   `undefined[month-1]` — a TypeError at render, not a benign miss — and the
 *   declared return type is non-nullable, so no caller checks.
 * - `lib/provinces.ts` `REGION_META`, read for `.color`, `.anchor` and `.label`
 *   in `CountryMap.tsx`. Same failure.
 *
 * `REGION_MONTHS` is also the runtime basis of `isChinaRegion`
 * (`mapTypes.ts` tests `hasOwnProperty` on it), so widening the key type would
 * break the guard and the thing the guard protects in one edit.
 *
 * So `ChinaRegion` stays seven members, `REGION_MONTHS` and `REGION_META` stay
 * keyed to it, and the level this module describes gets its own, deliberately
 * wide identifier. China's group ids happen to BE the seven `ChinaRegion`
 * strings — that is convenient for the chrome and it is a coincidence of value,
 * not of type. Narrowing `RegionId` to `ChinaRegion` would let the widening
 * this file exists to avoid arrive through the back door.
 *
 * `Destination.region` in `lib/types.ts` is plain `string` for exactly this
 * reason, so this is the shape the codebase already reaches for.

 *   click. The raw id is ugly; a blank label is worse.
 * - Every CN unit has `nameEn === null`, because the curated asset (§6.3, D7)
 *   is a re-envelope of DataV boundary data that carries one Chinese name and
 *   no second name field. The precedence alone would therefore label China's
 *   provinces 北京市 inside an otherwise English UI. `lib/provinces.ts` has the
 *   English name and the join key is the unit id, which for the curated asset

 * while ISO 3166-2 governs SUBDIVISION identity (§7.2) — Northern Cyprus,
 * Akrotiri and Dhekelia inside CY, Somaliland inside SO, Guantánamo inside CU,

 * outline without being a subdivision anyone can travel to.
 *
 * That drop is not free and is deliberate: 43 committed `cityProvince` values
