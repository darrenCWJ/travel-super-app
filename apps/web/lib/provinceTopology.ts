 *

 * its picker lists yields it (spec §4.1), which is why there is one artifact
 * family here rather than two. Measured across all 246 files, that merge tiles
 * every country — only 10 produce an interior ring and every one of those is a
 * genuine enclave.
 *
 * Fetched per country like a city shard, not read server-side: `public/` is
 * not readable from a Vercel lambda, so an `fs` read of one of these works
 * locally and 500s in production. `fetchProvinceTopology` at the foot of this
 * file is that fetch, and `MapExplorer` is its first caller.

 * reaches every city, while a surface that had nothing else to draw would want
 * to know. A fetcher that swallowed its own failure would take that choice
 * away from both of them.
