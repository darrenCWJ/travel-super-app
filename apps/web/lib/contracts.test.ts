   * and `MapCity` are the two shapes `lib/tripShared.ts` declares for a catalog
   * row and a map pin, both of which carry a GeoNames `name`.
   *
   * `\.destinations\b` and not a bare `destinations`: the loose form matches
   * app/layout.tsx's marketing copy ("pick destinations, tune the details"),
   * which is a page-level metadata string and renders no city at all. A
   * contract whose first finding is a false positive gets an allowlist entry
   * that then licenses a real violation in that file forever.
   *

   * the per-day field `lib/itinerary.ts` fills from the resolved destination's
   * `name` — the same GeoNames string as the plural, one day at a time — and it

   * lib/ is a different and much larger argument (every module that shapes city
   * data would become a candidate, and none of them renders anything), and it
   * is not made here.
   *

   * with the GeoNames `name` of a catalog stop, and the split moved the JSX
   * that prints them out of `MapExplorer.tsx` and into `RoutePanel.tsx` —
