/**
 * The render end of Task 15's lazy enrichment.
 *
 * `app/plan/page.tsx` fetches a blurb for a city the build never pre-fetched
 * and writes it to `extras[qid].description`. Until this file existed nothing
 * asserted that the string ever reached a user: `extras` has exactly one
 * consumer, the `picked` memo below, and `PickedPlace` had no `description`
 * field — so the fetched value was stored and dropped one hop later, and the
 * whole feature was invisible. A test that only checks the state was written
 * would have passed throughout. This one reads the DOM.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT named `DestinationStep.test.tsx`: Task 19's brief creates a
 * file at that path with prescribed content and would overwrite this one.
 *
 * `MapExplorer` is stubbed out. It owns four fetches and a topology parse and
 * has its own suite; what is under test here is the chain
 * `extras` -> `picked` -> `PlaceSearch` chip -> DOM.
