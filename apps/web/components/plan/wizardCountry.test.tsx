/**
 * Which country a finished trip is FOR, driven through the real wizard.
 *
 * The review's claim was that the country persisted with a trip is whichever
 * one the country picker was left on, so a trip whose only destination is in
 * Peru is built as a Japan trip if the picker moved afterwards — poisoning the
 * tips, the currency, the seasons and the glyphs the rest of this branch
 * derives from country. It was verified here rather than argued: the case
 * below marked THE DEFECT failed against the code as it stood, with the three
 * arming cases beside it green.
 *
 * `app/plan/page.tsx` can hold no test of its own (vitest.config.mts includes
 * only lib/, scripts/ and components/), so the page is imported and driven from
 * this side. That is the only way to see this at all: `TripInput.country` is
 * correct in isolation, `getCountry` is correct in isolation and each
 * destination's own country is correct in isolation — the defect was that the
 * wizard fed the plan the picker's value instead of the destinations'.
 *
 * Both pick kinds are exercised, and they fail differently. A hand-typed place
 * carries its own country (`addOffMap` stamps it), so it only needed the
 * wizard to read it. A catalog city carries none — a `CatalogHit` is a name, a
 * qid and a province — so it needed the wizard to record the scope the pick was
 * made in, which is a second mechanism and the more fragile one.
 */

/**
 * This file's budget, raised from vitest's 5,000ms default, and why.
 *
 * Every case drives the whole wizard: mount `PlanPage`, step into it, move the
 * picker, add a place, build the plan. That is the code under test rather than
 * scaffolding around it, and it cannot be shared — each case mutates the tree
 * it drives, so each needs its own mount. Verified, not assumed: the five pass
 * individually and in three shuffled orders.
 *
 * The expensive half that nothing asserts on has already left the enforced
 * budget for `beforeEach` (see `toDestinations`). Measured in one run, so both
 * halves met the same load, that took the worst case from 5,157ms — a timeout
 * — to a 2,369ms body. What remains is irreducible: idle bodies are 150-530ms,
 * and the whole problem is that a loaded CI box is not an idle box. Under 18
 * spinners on 20 cores these bodies ran 893-2,369ms, and under a heavier
 * concurrent load two still crossed 5,000ms with `Test timed out in 5000ms`.
 *
 * 15s is ~6x the measured heavy-load worst case and still nowhere near a hang.
 * `hookTimeout` matches it because the hook now carries the mount, and leaving
 * the two halves on different budgets would only move the cliff.
