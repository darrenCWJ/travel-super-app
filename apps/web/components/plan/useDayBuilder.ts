/**
 * The binding between the day-builder reducer and the trip accessor.
 *
 * Deliberately thin: every rule worth arguing about lives in `lib/dayBuilder.ts`
 * and is tested there (C3). This file owns three jobs and no logic — feed the
 * payload stream in, send one pending op at a time, and hand the reducer the
 * result.
 *
 * ⚠ Lives under `components/plan/` and not `lib/`. A React hook is neither pure
 * state nor layout-free, and the C3 scan in lib/contracts.test.ts fails any
 * day-builder hook found in lib/.

  // recomputes it from `plan.days` — and a plan rebuild can introduce a

  // flush lives in the reducer's own buffer and not here: after
  // endInteraction no new payload identity is guaranteed to arrive.
  //
  // `forcedAt` is the other half of the dependency. A forced refetch is the
  // accessor's post-error reconciliation path and it frequently returns the
  // *same* version — a rejected op writes nothing — so an unforced dispatch
  // would be dropped by the reducer's `baselineVersion >= payload.version`

  // One op per request: PlanEditSchema takes a single op and the route applies
  // exactly one under a version guard, so there is nothing to batch into.
  //
  // One op *in flight* at a time, too, which is a separate promise and the one
  // this used to break. The old guard skipped ops already sent but never waited
  // for them, so a second tap landing in its own render — 5-30ms is enough —
  // put two POSTs on the wire together. That is unsafe here specifically because
  // `setTiming` carries absolute values computed from optimistic state: if the
  // older op loses the version race, the route's CAS retry re-applies its stale
  // pair on top of the newer write and returns 200, so mashing +15m can settle
  // on any of the intermediate durations with no error anywhere.
  //

  // one, and `pendingOps` is append-ordered, so taking the head sends them FIFO.
