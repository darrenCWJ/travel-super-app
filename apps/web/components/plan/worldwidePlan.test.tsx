/**
 * T30 — the Peru acceptance gate, jsdom half.
 *
 * `lib/worldwidePlan.test.ts` proves the *generators* produce nothing Chinese
 * for Peru. This proves the same of what a person actually sees, over the three
 * surfaces the country's guidance is drawn on — which are, not by coincidence,
 * the three `components/plan/GapNote.tsx` names in its own docblock:
 *
 *   1. `components/PlanStep.tsx`   — the wizard's plan preview.
 *   2. `components/trip/PlanTab.tsx` (+ `PackingSection`) — the saved trip.
 *   3. `components/trip/BriefingView.tsx` — the **unauthenticated** briefing.
 *
 * **Why the third one has no test of its own under `app/`.** The public page is
 * `app/b/[code]/page.tsx`, and `vitest.config.mts` includes nothing under
 * `app/` — a test file placed there would sit on disk and never run. That page
 * does exactly two things worth testing: it calls
 * `buildBriefing(payload, { redacted: true, includeBookings })` and hands the
 * result to `<BriefingView>`. Both halves are exercised here, with the same
 * redacted options, so the surface is covered by its two real parts rather than
 * by a file that could not execute.
 *
 * **What is scanned is `innerHTML`, not `textContent`.** It is a strict
 * superset: it catches copy that lives in an `aria-label`, a `title` or an
 * `alt` as well as copy a sighted user reads. Nothing in the class names or the
 * CSS variables this app uses contains a China marker, so the extra surface
 * costs no false positives.
 *
 * **Everything expensive is built once, at module scope.** Resolving GeoNames
 * cities parses a 58,742-row index; done inside a `test` that cost lands in
 * that test's wall-clock budget and flakes under parallel load (commit
 * 84cd61e). Each `test` below renders and scans, and nothing more.

/**
 * FINDING 1 (T30), fixed — the render-time rail glyph, on every country.
 *
 * `lib/meta.ts`'s `KIND_EMOJI.travel` was `"🚄"`, stamped on every `kind:
 * "travel"` itinerary item by all three renderers (`PlanStep`'s `PlanItem`,
 * `DayCard`, `BriefingView`'s `DayPanel`). It was not country-aware, so a
 * Peruvian hop whose *title* is the neutral "Travel to Cusco" was drawn with a
 * Chinese high-speed-train glyph — on the unauthenticated briefing included.
 *
 * **This is the seam this gate exists to find, and the reason it had to be a
 * RENDER test.** The generated plan was always clean: `lib/worldwidePlan.test.ts`
 * scans the same trip's data and reports nothing, because the glyph does not
 * exist until render. Every data-layer suite in the phase was blind to it, and
 * so was the design — it asserts "Zero 🚄 anywhere" for Peru while no task in
 * T20–T32 touched `lib/meta.ts`. Nothing but a scan of `innerHTML` could have
 * caught it, which is what the three `chinaLeaks(render…)` pins below are.
 *
 * The glyph now comes from `travelEmoji(railKmh)`: `🚄` where a country has a
 * researched rail speed, `🧭` where it has none. Not `✈️` — the resolution is
 * per country, not per leg, so a plane would be the same unsourced claim
 * reversed. Both glyphs are asserted in both directions below: a Peru surface
 * must show the neutral one and never the rail one, a China surface the
 * reverse. Without the positive halves of those pairs, "no 🚄 on the Peru page"
 * would also be satisfied by rendering no hop at all.

 * one span — so the raw markup has no shared substring to match. Stripping tags
 * leaves the one thing all three agree on: "<glyph> <title>".
 *
 * This is not fussiness. `🧳` was the first choice for the neutral glyph and it

 * China rather than about the trip: the `启程` chop on the boarding-pass
 * header, the headline "Your China itinerary", and `一起走` in the
 * share-a-trip card. A Peru traveller saw all three.
 *
 * **T31 fixed the first two**, wiring both through `getCountry(...)` — the
 * same accessor `TripView.tsx` already used for its own hero. That resolves
 * the self-contradiction this finding originally flagged: the design's own
 * T31 test story claimed `启程` would still appear for CN after the fix, but
 * `getCountry("CN").mark` is `同行`, not `启程` — they are two different
 * chops that happened to occupy the same spot in two different components.
 * `TripView.tsx`'s docblock is explicit that `同行` is the mark every
 * mark-bearing country (CN included) is meant to show, so T31 took
 * consistency with `TripView` over the stale test-story wording. CN's wizard
 * chop changing from `启程` to `同行` is the one deliberate change to China's
 * rendered output this task makes — see the arming test below.
 *
 * `一起走` in the share-a-trip card was never on T31's file:line list. It went
 * with the card itself in phase 1's slice A, which retired trip creation.
