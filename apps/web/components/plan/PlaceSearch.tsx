 *

 * The 51 rows that remain make 55 name-pairs — Longnan and Jinzhou each match
 * two catalog cities — and 40 of those pairs, across 36 distinct names, are

 * each source picked, and those are the ones suppressed.
 *
 * `CatalogHit` carries no coordinates, so distance is not available to key on

 * direction: it keeps a duplicate whose two labels name the same place at
 * different levels (the catalog's "Meizhou" against the shard's "Guangdong",
 * 6 of the 51), and it drops Jinzhou (Liaoning), where the catalog's
 * prefecture-level city and the shard's Dalian district really are two places
 * 229 km apart under one province. Both are quieter failures than offering 15
 * duplicate cities, which `app/plan/page.tsx` will accept twice because it
