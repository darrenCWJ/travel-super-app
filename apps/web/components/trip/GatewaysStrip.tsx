/**
 * The airports the trip flies into and out of (spec §10.3), above the plan.
 *
 * A strip rather than a card: it is one line of fact, and it sits above the
 * day list because the day list is what it frames. Editing never touches the
 * plan — the save goes to /gateways, which writes `input` alone — so the
 * strip can be corrected mid-trip without a tick being lost.
 *
 * Codes, not names, on purpose: the strip is browser-side and has no airport
 * array to resolve a name from, and a code is what a boarding pass says.
 *
 * The strip itself prints. Which airports a trip flies into and out of is
 * precisely the sort of line a traveller wants on the page they carry, so
 * `print:hidden` sits on the two things that cannot be acted on from paper —
 * the "Edit gateways" button and the editor it opens — rather than on the
 * section that would take the fact down with them.

   * dropping a code the trip already had, for a member whose only mistake was
   * tapping Save before picking from the list. Since the tap itself blurs the
   * field and closes the list, that is a very easy mistake to make and an
   * invisible one to notice.
   *
   * A list pick cannot strand this flag: the transient `onChange(null, text)`
   * that precedes it is fired in the same event as the pick, so both updates
   * land in one batch and the pick's `false` is the last word.
