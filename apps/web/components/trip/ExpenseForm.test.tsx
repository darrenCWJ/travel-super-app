/**
 * Editing an expense seeds its amount field from the stored minor-unit
 * value via `minorToMajorInput` (lib/money.ts) -- the declared inverse of
 * the `majorToMinor` parser Task 3 made currency-aware. Before that inverse
 * existed, the prefill was a hardcoded `(amount / 100).toFixed(2)`, which
 * disagrees with `majorToMinor` the moment a currency isn't exponent-2: a
 * three-decimal currency's stored amount gets silently multiplied by ten on
 * an untouched re-save, and a zero-decimal currency's edit can't be saved at
 * all. These tests drive the real form end to end -- render with a stored
 * expense, click Save without touching anything, inspect what onSubmit
 * actually received -- rather than testing lib/money.ts in isolation.
