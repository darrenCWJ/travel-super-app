 *
 * The report is re-derived from the text on every change; a list pick is the
 * only path that carries an `airport`. So editing the text after a pick
 * drops the pick by construction — there is no separate "was this picked"
 * flag that could fall out of sync with what the text actually says. (A list
 * pick does deliver one transient `onChange(null, displayString)` immediately
 * before the pick — from `AirportInput`'s own `onChange` of the display
 * string, fired in the same event as the pick itself. Harmless for a parent
 * that only sets state, since both calls land in one batch and the pick is
 * the last word; worth knowing for one that does work per call.)
