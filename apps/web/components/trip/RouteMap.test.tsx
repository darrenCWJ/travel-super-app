  /**
   * The province level's own version of the same statement — Plan 4's Task 10.

   * `zoomRegion` used to be `ChinaRegion | null`, which made this surface's
   * `null` the only value it could carry outside China. Phase 4 widened it to
   * `RegionId` — `string` — so `null` stayed assignable, `tsc` stayed quiet,
   * and this call site is the one the widening could not point at. Everything
   * else that reads the prop is in `MapExplorer`, where the change is obvious;
   * here it is invisible, which is why it gets asserted rather than assumed.
   *
   * A known gap, seen and left alone: on the China branch `ChinaLevel` still
   * draws its seven provinces with `role="button"` and "Zoom into East China"
   * for a name, wired here to `noop`. That IS a control that cannot do
   * anything, and it is exactly what `readOnly` exists to suppress — but
   * `readOnly` is deliberately not spread into `ChinaLevel` (§9.5 freezes
   * China's rendered output for the whole of Phase 4, and `CountryMap` says so
   * at its own prop). Suppressing it is a change to a China render, so it
   * belongs to whoever lifts §9.5, not to this task.
