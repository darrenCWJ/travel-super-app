 * timer *fire*; `settle()` is what makes its consequences *land*. Splitting
 * the wait along that seam is the whole point of the helper.
 *
 * A bare 450ms sleep used to be the entire wait, and its 150ms over the
 * debounce looked like headroom. It is not headroom, because both timers are
 * read off the same blocked clock: starve the event loop past 450ms and the
 * debounce (due at +300) and the sleep (due at +450) come due together and run
 * back to back inside one timers phase. The sleep then resolves in the very
 * turn the fetch was issued, with the promise settlement and React's re-render
 * still queued behind it, and the assertion reads a DOM exactly one commit
 * stale. That was measured, not assumed: at the moment of the failing
 * assertion `fetch` had already been called once, and a single `act` flush —
 * no further wall-clock time at all — flipped `aria-expanded` back to "false".
 *
 * What survives is only the half of the old sleep that is a real guarantee: a
 * timer due at +450 runs after one due at +300 however slow the machine,
 * because ordering does not depend on speed. Waiting for the work itself is
 * then `settle()`'s job, and it waits for the work rather than racing a clock.
 * vitest's own testTimeout stays as the backstop for a genuine hang, which is
 * the only thing a timeout should be catching.
