/**
 * Spec §2.1's map view of the itinerary — the thing that justified taking Route
 * out of the nav: "a map ⇄ list toggle *inside* Plan. It is a view of the
 * itinerary, not a sibling of it."
 *
 * Deliberately **read-only**, and it now says so with a prop rather than with a
 * `noop`. `CountryMap` is the picker from the wizard, where tapping a place
 * selects it; here there is nothing to select — the plan already exists, and
 * this is a view of it. Every place on the map is one of the trip's own stops,
 * drawn in day order.
 *
 * The inert callback used to be the whole of that statement, and it stopped
 * being enough the moment `CountryLevel` grew controls (§5.3): a marker
 * announced itself as a pressed toggle, held a tab stop, and opened a card
 * whose primary button reads "Remove <name> from trip" — all of it wired to
 * the noop, on a surface a shared link is one component away from reaching.
 * `readOnly` is what the level is actually built from now; `noop` remains only
 * for the two branches that were always inert and have nothing to suppress —
 * `ChinaLevel`, frozen by §9.5, and the stop list, which is §5.2's spine.
 *
 * Off-map stops never resolve to coordinates, and a curated destination without
 * coordinates cannot be drawn, so both simply do not appear — the day list
 * remains the complete record and this is a view of the part that can be
 * plotted.
 *
 * **It was blank for every worldwide trip on two counts, and PR4 fixes both.**
 * The stops came from the bundled curated set, which is sixteen Chinese cities,
 * so a Peruvian trip drew nothing at all; and the geometry came from
 * `/china-provinces.json` whatever country the trip was in, so there was
 * nothing to draw it on. Each is now a fetch, and the two are independent:
 * geometry that never arrives costs the drawing and never the stops (§5.2).
 *
 * **Everything it fetches answers a signed-out request, and that was checked
 * rather than assumed.** §5.1 calls this "a guest-reachable surface", which is
 * true of the PAGE and not of this component: `lib/wall.ts` passes
 * `/trip/<id>?code=…`, but `resolveTripAccess` answers `guest` for a request
 * with no session, and `TripView` renders `GuestTripView` — not `PlanTab`, and
 * so not this — for anything short of `member`. So a shared trip link does not
 * reach here today.
 *
 * The property is still worth holding, because losing it is silent: a fetch
 * that needs a session works for every developer and every member and fails
 * only for the visitor the guest branch is one component away from gaining.
 * `/api/destinations/resolve` is guest-safe on both counts — the wall passes
 * every `/api/` path, and the route reads no session — and `RouteMap.test.tsx`
 * pins it. The province files are NOT: they are static assets behind the wall,
 * so a guest who ever did mount this would get the stops without the geometry,
 * which is the same fallback a 500 gets.
 */

/**
 * The callback the branches that cannot be switched off still require.
 *
 * `readOnly` on the `CountryLevel` branch is what actually makes this surface a
 * view; this is what `ChinaLevel` (§9.5: untouched) and the stop list get, and
 * neither has ever offered a card. It is no longer standing in for a mode.
