/**
 * §10.1's other clause: "Airports are never selectable trip stops and the
 * types must enforce it."
 *
 * A compile-time block on purpose. The runtime half already exists —
 * `CountryLevel.airports.test.tsx`'s "clicking an airport mark does not select
 * anything" — and all it can prove is that the layer *as written* never calls
 * `onTogglePlace`. It cannot prove that a later edit could not, and that is
 * the failure the spec is worried about.
 *
 * Why the structural mismatch is not enough on its own: widening
 * `MapPlace["kind"]` to `"curated" | "catalog" | "airport"` — the obvious way
 * to draw the layer through the selection machinery that already exists — and
 * running `npx tsc --noEmit` over the whole repo reports ZERO errors. That was
 * measured before this block was written, not assumed. Every reader of `kind`
 * is `=== "curated"` with an implicit else (`CountryLevel.tsx:401`,
 * `CountryMap.tsx:290`, `PlacePopup.tsx:43`), so a third member changes no
 * branch and `MapExplorer.togglePlace` starts adding airports to trips. The
 * `kind` test below is the only line in the codebase that goes red for it.
 *
 * Each `@ts-expect-error` here is an assertion that reverses: it is satisfied
 * while the line beneath it is illegal, and becomes an error in its own right
 * — TS2578, unused directive — the moment that line becomes legal. `npx tsc
 * --noEmit` is what runs them; `vitest` only checks the companions.
