/**
 * The globe world level: the same country picker as `WorldMap`, on a sphere.
 *
 * Structurally it *is* `WorldMap` — the same fetch, the same split memo, the
 * same `worldLevelShared` selection, picker, card, error and skeleton. Only
 * the projection differs, and everything below follows from that one change.
 *
 * **A clipping projection makes "drawn" a moving target.** Orthographic hides
 * half the planet, so the set of countries with an SVG node changes as the
 * globe turns. `entries` — the A–Z list, the roving tabindex order, the
 * selected-country card — is derived from the *features*, never from what got
 * drawn, so which side of the world is facing the user cannot change what
 * exists. `mounted` is the moving half, and only `tabStop` reads it.
 *
 * **A back-face country gets no node at all.** Not a hidden one: `opacity: 0`
 * removes an element from neither the accessibility tree nor the focus order,
 * so up to 151 invisible `role="button"` nodes would announce phantom controls
 * to a screen reader and hand a sighted keyboard user focus with no visible
 * indicator — WCAG 2.2 AA 2.4.7 and 2.4.11. `aria-hidden` is not the way out
 * either; `aria-hidden` on a focusable element is its own violation.
 *
 * **Focus drives rotation.** Because the far side has no nodes, the keyboard
 * would otherwise be able to reach only whichever hemisphere happened to be
 * facing the user. `useCountrySelection` reports a move onto an unmounted
 * country instead of silently no-op'ing, the globe turns to it, and focus is
 * applied once the rotation has brought the node into being.
 *
 * **A spin can outlive the node the caret was on.** The origin country crosses
 * the limb part-way through, its node is removed, and a removed element takes
 * the caret with it — neither browsers nor jsdom fire `blur` or `focusout` for
 * a focused element that is deleted, so `document.activeElement` falls back to
 * <body>. On the real asset that leaves a gap on 18 of the 104 arrow
 * transitions that need a spin, up to ~104ms in which an arrow key reaches no
 * handler at all and is silently swallowed. The `<svg>` therefore takes
 * `tabIndex={-1}` and holds the caret for the duration — focusable so it can,
 * -1 so it never becomes a Tab stop, and running the active country's key
 * handler so the keys keep working while its node does not exist.
 *
 * **One country owns the caret, and the hook is the one that names it.** All
 * three of those — park, run-the-handler, deliver-once-mounted — need to know
 * *which* country the caret belongs to, and that country is
 * `useCountrySelection`'s `activeCode`: the value `focusEntry` writes on every
 * move and the value `refocus` focuses. This file keeps no second copy of it.
 * It used to, as a `pendingFocus` ref written only from `onFocusOffscreen` —
 * which the hook calls only when the destination is *unmounted*, so a single
 * arrow key onto a country that happened to be facing the viewer moved
 * `activeCode` and left `pendingFocus` on the country before it. From there
 * the parking aimed at one country while `refocus()` fired at another, and
 * both of the defects the parking exists to prevent came straight back. What
 * this file does track is a boolean: whether the *keyboard* or the *pointer*
 * is driving. A boolean cannot name the wrong country.
 *
 * `document` is read here — `activeElement` and `body`, by `caretIsOurs` and
 * by the effect that calls it — because asking where the caret actually is has
 * no other answer. Every one of those reads happens while that effect is
 * running, so nothing touches `document` during render or at module scope and
 * the file still renders on the server. Earlier notes on this file said it had
 * no `document` reference at all; that stopped being true when the caret
 * needed parking.
 *
 * **The point layer needs a guard the flat map does not.** `geoPath` clips
 * polygon geometry at the limb and returns null beyond it, but a bare
 * `projection([lon, lat])` does not clip at all — centred on China it places
 * Buenos Aires 70px from the middle of the disc, drawn over Asia and fully
 * clickable from the far side of the planet. Every point passes
 * `isFrontFacing` before it is drawn or made a target. This matters more here
 * than it would on the 50m asset: 61 of the 110m point-layer countries have no
 * polygon underneath them at all, so the point is the *only* thing that would
 * be wrong.
