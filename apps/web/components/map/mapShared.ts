/**
 * Zoom transform that frames `features` within the shared viewBox. The maths
 * lives in `lib/mapTransform` and is tested there; this only turns features
 * into the pixel bounds it wants.
 *
 * **This is where spec §6.2's degenerate-bounds guard lives, and it lives here
 * because it is a fact about the caller and not about the maths.**
 * `transformForBounds` refuses the guard in its own docblock — a fallback
 * invented inside the arithmetic would hide the bug of asking to zoom to
 * nothing — and this function is its only caller in the app, so guarding once
 * here covers every level that zooms.
 *
 * The hazard is narrower than §6.2 states. A single point is the case it names,
 * and at the real 860 x 620 viewBox that case is fine: `860/0` and `620/0` are
 * both `Infinity`, and `MAX_ZOOM_K` clamps the result to exactly the
 * scale a 4px unit would have received. Guarding zero extent would therefore
 * send a legitimately tiny province back to identity. What has no defined
 * answer is an EMPTY collection — a group whose filter matched no unit, or
 * whose units carry no drawable geometry — for which d3 answers
 * `[[∞, ∞], [-∞, -∞]]` and the maths answers `scale(-0)` at
 * `translate(NaN, NaN)`: a map that vanishes rather than one that misframes.
 *
 * Finiteness is the test rather than `features.length`, because the two failure
 * modes are the same failure: what matters is whether anything was drawn, not
 * whether anything was passed.
 *
 * `maxK` is the caller's zoom ceiling and defaults to `MAX_ZOOM_K`, which is
 * what `ChinaLevel` takes: its seven curated regions are several provinces each
 * and the ceiling is a guard they never reach. `CountryLevel` frames ONE
 * admin-1 unit and passes `ADMIN1_MAX_ZOOM_K` instead, because at 5 the ceiling
 * stops being a guard and becomes the framing — 3,039 of the 4,525 committed
 * groups hit it, and Rhode Island ends up filling 0.14% of the viewBox. The
 * argument for the number, and for why two paths need two, is on that constant.
