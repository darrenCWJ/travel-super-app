/**
 * The selected-place card (spec §5.3.3) — a net-new surface, not a variant of
 * `PlacePopup`.
 *
 * `PlacePopup` is `role="tooltip"` and `pointer-events-none`, positioned from
 * `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseMove` alone. That is a correct tooltip and it stays
 * exactly as it is; what it cannot be is a **destination**. It has no touch
 * story at all — with no hover there is nothing to open it — nothing inside it
 * can be operated, which is why its own call to action is a sentence asking you
 * to click the marker underneath it, and it cannot hold focus, so it can say
 * nothing to a keyboard user. The roadmap's §6.4 assumed "a selected city's
 * card" it could add an airport line to already existed. It did not exist
 * anywhere in the map layer.
 *
 * So this is that card: it opens from a tap or from Enter/Space on a marker, it
 * takes focus when the keyboard opened it and gives it back on dismiss, it
 * dismisses on Escape and on a click outside, and it carries controls. PR7's
 * climate `lo`/`hi` line and PR8's "Main airport: TNA · 30 km" (§10.2) go into
 * `children`.
 *
 * **Additive, and that is a constraint rather than a description.** Hover keeps
 * opening the tooltip and nothing else, because the two surfaces would open at
 * the same point under the same cursor — the tooltip follows the pointer, and
 * the card anchors to the marker the pointer is on. The modality each serves is
 * the one the other cannot: hover for the mouse, tap and Enter for everything
 * else.
