   * makes that decision survive a later PR that adds an outline.
   *
   * Run once per RENDERING the country level can produce, and that is the
   * whole point of the shape below. When Plan 3 made `provinces: null` the
   * default in `renderMap`, every case here quietly became the list-only

   * HAS a map, so the branch with geometry is asserted here rather than left
   * to `CountryLevel.test.tsx` — which is a different file, and not the one

   * reach a place, it is the ONLY way to reach the 80 cities the map has just
   * taken off screen. A level that filtered the list alongside the markers, or

     * would go on passing while the layer added a control, a tab stop or a
     * marker to every country in the app. What §12.2 asks is that the level not
     * change how a place is reached; an airport is not a place, so the layer's
     * correct effect on every count here is exactly zero, in both directions.
     *
     * Both directions, and that is not pedantry: the failure that matters is a
     * layer drawn as `<g role="button">` — the shape §5.3.1 already uses for a
     * marker, and the obvious way to make an airport clickable later — which
     * ADDS reachable controls that lead nowhere. A layer that swallowed taps
     * from the markers beneath it would subtract instead. Equality catches both
     * and is what "decorative" means when written as an assertion.
     *
     * The explicit timeout is the cost of that: three renderings of a 200-city
     * map where every neighbour in this block renders one, at ~700ms each with
     * `getAllByRole` over ~400 controls as most of it. ~2s in isolation, and
     * over vitest's 5s default under the full suite where 119 files share the
     * box. Raised rather than trimmed: the equality between the three IS the
     * deliverable, and a cheaper baseline would be a different claim.
