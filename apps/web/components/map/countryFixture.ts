/**
 * The hand-built admin-1 country both country-level test files are held to.
 *
 * Its own module for the reason `worldFixture.ts` gives and spec §12.1
 * restates: a fixture shared between two test files lives in a plain non-test
 * module, because importing one `.test.tsx` from another makes vitest collect
 * the imported file's `describe` blocks a second time. Nothing under `app/` or
 * `components/` imports it, so it never reaches a bundle.
 *
 * It is shared rather than duplicated because §12.2's acceptance criterion is
 * asserted against BOTH renderers — `CountryLevel` directly, and `CountryMap`
 * once per dispatcher branch — and a second copy of this topology would let
 * the two drift into testing different countries under the same name.
 *
 * The fixture is four admin-1 units rather than a real file, and its shape is
 * the specification of what the country level has to get right:
 *
 * - **three units tile the mainland and share their arcs**, so `merge()` has a
 *   seam to dissolve and the outline is one ring rather than three;
 * - **one of those three is `sel: 0`** — the Northern-Cyprus case of §7.2, drawn
 *   because it shapes the country's extent, never offered as a choice;
 * - **the fourth is an island 32° west of the mainland**, which is what makes
 *   the manifest observable: framed by the manifest entry the mainland fills
 *   the viewport, and framed by a fit over the features it is a sixth of it.
 *
 * Rings are wound clockwise in (lon, lat). d3-geo reads them spherically, and
 * the anticlockwise version of this same fixture measures 25.1 steradians —
 * twice the whole sphere — because each ring reads as the globe minus itself.
 * `geoBounds` then answers ±180/±90 and every fit collapses.

/**
 * Where each city both test files draw is committed to live.
 *
 * A real province file assigns every city in the country's shard to one of its
 * units, and this fixture said `{}` — "no city is anywhere" — for as long as
 * nothing read the field. `CountryLevel`'s province zoom is its first reader
 * (§6.5), and under a zoom an unassigned city is drawn nowhere at all, so an
 * empty map here is not a neutral default: it is the state in which the zoomed
 * map is blank.
 *
 * The assignments are the ones this fixture's own geometry implies, so a
 * reader can check them against the arcs above rather than take them on trust.
 * The units span PE-LIM over lon -78..-76, PE-CUS over -76..-74, PE-XXX over
 * -74..-72, and PE-ISL out at -110..-109:
 *
 * - `lima` (-78) and `cur` (-77.5) fall in **PE-LIM**;
 * - `b` (-75.95) falls in **PE-CUS**, and `a` (-76) sits on its seam with
 *   PE-LIM, so it is assigned east to keep the crowded pair in one unit;
 * - `cty` (-73) and `cusco` (-72) fall in **PE-XXX**, which is `sel: 0` — so
 *   they are this fixture's copy of the 43 committed `cityProvince` values
 *   that name a unit no user can zoom to. Both cities exist and the list
 *   reaches them; no region ever draws them;
 * - `isla` (-109.5) falls in **PE-ISL**.
 *
 * Deliberately partial in two places. `CountryLevel.test.tsx` draws an
 * `unplaced` city that appears nowhere here, because "assigned to no unit" is
 * the state 478 real cities are in and the level has to answer for it. And
 * `CountryMap.test.tsx`'s own cast is absent because that renderer does not
 * zoom yet; when it does, `peFileWith` is what places its cities without
 * putting a second copy of this topology in a second file.
