/**
 * The province zoom, and the `/ k` discipline it drags in behind it (§6.1).
 *
 * Until now this level applied no transform at all: `k` was implicitly 1, and
 * every stroke, radius and font was written as the plain number it wanted to be
 * on screen. A zoom makes that assumption false everywhere at once. The group
 * is magnified by `k`, so a constant left undivided is drawn over `k` times as
 * many CSS pixels — a 0.7-unit border becomes a 2.4-pixel one, and the 44px tap
 * target becomes 44k.
 *
 * So the property asserted here is ONE property, not fifteen: **everything
 * except the projected position divides by `k`.** The positions do not, because
 * the transform is what moves them; every length, radius, dash and font does,
 * because the transform is what magnifies them. The test renders the same map
 * twice — once unzoomed and once framed on one province — and holds every
 * attribute to that ratio, so a constant added later without a `/ k` fails here
 * rather than on someone's screen.
 *
 * `PE-ISL` is the region under test because it is the only one of the three
 * that magnifies. The two mainland units are 2° wide and 4° tall inside a frame
 * that is 6° by 4°, so latitude constrains their fit and `k` lands just under 1
 * — arithmetically correct, and useless for telling `x` from `x / k`. The
 * island is 1° square and reaches 3.46.
