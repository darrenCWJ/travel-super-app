/**
 * §9.5's success test: **China's rendered output is byte-identical before and
 * after Phase 4.** "Any change to a China pin colour or popup line is a
 * regression, and this is the only thing that would catch it."
 *
 * Every other Phase 4 test asserts a property — that a control exists, that a
 * fetch was aimed at the right file, that a scale follows from its bounds. None
 * of them can catch China getting *slightly different*, because nobody wrote
 * down what China looked like. `chinaBaseline.ts` did: its markup strings came
 * out of the pre-Phase-4 components at commit `3030f29`, not out of this tree,
 * so this file is a comparison against the past rather than a snapshot of the
 * present.
 *
 * That is what makes it worth the 12 KB of frozen markup. Phase 4 moved the
 * dispatcher around `ChinaLevel`, lifted `originLine` out of `PlacePopup` into
 * `mapTypes.originLineFor`, and added a second consumer of it — three edits
 * that each *could* have moved a China surface by a character and that no
 * behavioural assertion in the suite would have noticed.
 *
 * The two China renders are driven through `CountryMap`, not through
 * `ChinaLevel` directly, because the dispatcher in front of it is the thing
 * Phase 4 actually rewrote: a routing mistake that sent China through
 * `CountryLevel` would draw a real map, pass every list assertion, and fail
 * only here.
 *
 * The other half of §9.5 lives in `MapExplorer.provinces.test.tsx`'s "China
 * fetches its province file and manifest, like every other country", which
 * pins the INPUT — and now asserts the opposite of what this paragraph
 * used to claim: China reaches for `/provinces/CN.json` and the manifest,
 * and never for `/china-provinces.json`. That test proves China is fetched
 * through the same path as every other country; this one proves the map
 * built from that path still renders the same output.

 * China's card output, still pinned byte for byte.

 * This file used to hold four baselines. Two of them — the country level and an

 * had, and they existed to enforce §9.5: "China's rendered output is
 * byte-identical before and after Phase 4."
 *
 * That requirement was deliberately retired. China now renders through
 * `CountryLevel` over `public/provinces/CN.json` like the other 245 countries,
 * because a worldwide planner in which one country answers to a different
 * control is a planner the reader has to learn twice — and because both of the
 * affordances China was missing (the province picker and the airport layer)
 * were gated on `!hasCurated`. `CountryMap.test.tsx` holds the routing now, and
 * `CountryLevel.test.tsx` holds the rendering.
 *
 * The two popup baselines below are NOT part of that retirement and are kept
 * verbatim. `PlacePopup` was never China-specific and did not change: the seven
 * regions still key `REGION_MONTHS` (§6.4 keeps them "preserved verbatim"), so
 * "North China", the climate row, the crowd dots and the holiday glyph are all
 * still claims this app makes about a Chinese place, and a regression in any of
 * them would still be a regression.
