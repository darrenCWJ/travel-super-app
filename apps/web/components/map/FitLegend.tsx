/**
 * The key to the marker colours.
 *
 * China's map had one until `ChinaLevel` was retired in 960a6bd. `MapExplorer`
 * hands it to `CountryLevel`'s `belowMap` slot, so it sits under the map for
 * every country whose geometry loaded, climate or no climate, because "No
 * data" is a colour that needs explaining too. Now that every country's pins
 * carry a verdict (§9.4), a map with five colours and no key is one only its
 * author can read.
 *
 * Five existing bands in `FIT_ORDER`, drawn from `FIT_COLORS` and
 * `FIT_LABELS` and nothing else: no new swatch, no colour change, so §9.4's
 * "no contrast re-audit" holds — these are the solid swatches the audit in
 * `mapTypes.ts` was run on.
 *
 * `role="list"` beside the element for the reason `MapExplorer`'s route list
 * gives: Tailwind's preflight strips list markers and Safari/VoiceOver then
 * drop the implicit role, so a labelled list without it is announced as a
 * bare group. Nothing here is operable — a key is not a control, and the
 * tap-target sweep counts controls.
