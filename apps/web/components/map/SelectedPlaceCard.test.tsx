/**
 * §5.3.3: the surface `PlacePopup` is not.
 *
 * `PlacePopup` is `role="tooltip"`, `pointer-events-none`, and positioned from
 * `onMouseEnter`/`onMouseMove` alone — so on a touch screen, where there is no
 * hover, a marker's details are unreachable, and on any screen the popup's own
 * "Click to select" line is the only call to action it can offer, because
 * nothing inside it can be clicked. This card is the other half: it opens from
 * a tap, it takes focus when the keyboard opened it, it dismisses, and things
 * inside it can be operated. It is where PR7's climate line and PR8's airport
 * line land.
 *
 * **Additive.** The popup keeps hover; the card is what tap and Enter now get.
 * The two never both open for one marker — see the hover test at the foot.
 *
 * The fixture is one unit and two cities, deliberately unlike
 * `CountryLevel.test.tsx`'s Peru: seams for `merge()` to dissolve, a `sel: 0`
 * unit and an island the manifest trims are the specification of the LEVEL, and
 * none of them change what a card does when it is tapped. The ring is wound
 * clockwise in (lon, lat) for the reason that file gives — d3-geo reads rings
 * spherically, and the anticlockwise version is the globe minus the country.

/**
 * §6.5's zoom, and the one thing about this card a transform breaks.
 *
 * The card is an HTML sibling of the `<svg>`, positioned in the viewBox's own
 * fractions — `anchor.y / MAP_VIEW_H * 100` — so **no SVG transform reaches
 * it**. The marker it belongs to lives inside `[data-zoom]` and is moved by
 * one. A zoom therefore separates the two unless the anchor is where the
 * marker is DRAWN rather than where it was projected, and on the island that
 * gap is 2,300 viewBox units: the card would sit four frame-heights below a
 * marker the zoom has centred, on the surface that is a touch user's only way
 * into a place.
 *
 * **Only the `top` axis is readable here, and that is jsdom's limit rather
 * than a choice.** The `left` declaration is wrapped in a `clamp()` — §5.4
 * leaves nine countries with markers at negative x and the card still has to
 * be reachable for them — and jsdom's CSS parser drops the whole declaration
 * rather than storing a value it cannot compute, so `style.left` is absent in
 * every render, zoomed or not. The x axis is pinned instead where it is
 * computed: `paintedAt` in `CountryLevel.zoom.test.tsx`.
 *
 * A second fixture, and it has to be a second one: the card's own topology
 * above is a single selectable unit, which is exactly the country §6.6's gate
 * leaves nothing to zoom to. `countryFixture.ts` is the shared four-unit Peru
 * both country-level test files are held to, and it exists so a file that
 * needs a zoomable country does not make a third copy of the topology.
