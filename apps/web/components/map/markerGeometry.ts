/**
 * The zoom ceiling for the ADMIN-1 path — 1091.2, against `MAX_ZOOM_K`'s 5.
 *
 * ## Why the two paths differ
 *
 * `MAX_ZOOM_K` was tuned for `ChinaLevel`, and correctly. Its seven groups are
 * several provinces each, and measured against the curated asset they actually
 * render the fits run 1.885 (Northwest) to 3.755 (Central) — so on the real
 * China map the ceiling never fires at all, and 5 is a guard rather than a
 * policy.
 *
 * This level frames ONE admin-1 unit, which is a different regime by two orders
 * of magnitude: over the committed province files, **3,039 of the 4,525
 * zoomable groups (67.2%) fit above 5x.** For them the shared ceiling was not a
 * guard, it was the framing, and it framed badly — Rhode Island covers 0.14% of
 * the viewBox at 5x against 36.3% fitted, Delhi 0.45% against 54.9%, Jakarta
 * 0.16% against 52.5%. "Zoom to this province" left the province a speck in the
 * middle of an empty frame.
 *
 * Nothing that `MAX_ZOOM_K`'s docblock warns about applies here. "The outlines
 * become a handful of fat strokes and the labels outgrow the map" is a fact
 * about lengths that do NOT divide by `k`, and every length in this file does —
 * that is the whole of the discipline the marker constants above describe. A
 * magnified unit is drawn with the same stroke weights, marker radii and font
 * sizes on screen at `k` = 800 as at `k` = 1.
 *
 * ## Why this number
 *
 * Derived from an extent rather than picked as a magnification: it is the scale
 * a square unit of `MIN_FRAMED_EXTENT` viewBox units is fitted at. That puts
 * the number that has to be defended into the map's own units, where it can be
 * checked against the geometry — which is what `MIN_FRAMED_EXTENT` does — and
 * leaves this constant as arithmetic. A ceiling chosen directly in `k` would be
 * a magnification with nothing to measure it against, which is how 5 came to
 * outlive the framing it was chosen for.
 *
 * It remains a real ceiling. `transformForBounds` divides by the bounds' extent
 * and answers `Infinity` for a point, so something finite has to stop it; ten
 * groups in the committed set reach this one.

/**
 * `--tap-min` as a marker radius in viewBox units, at a given rendered width
 * (§5.3.2).
 *
 * The SVG is `w-full` over a fixed 860-unit viewBox, so one viewBox unit is
 * `renderedWidth / MAP_VIEW_W` CSS pixels — 1.30px across a 1120px desktop
 * column, 0.45px across a 390px phone. A radius in viewBox units is therefore
 * a different number of pixels on every viewport, and it moves the OPPOSITE
 * way from the viewport: a NARROWER screen stretches the same viewBox over
 * FEWER pixels, each unit is worth less, and the compliant radius is LARGER.
 * 16.9 units on the desktop column; 48.5 on the phone.
 *
 * That inversion is why this is a function of a measured width and not the
 * constant it obviously wants to be. Folding `MAP_MAX_RENDER_W` in and calling
 * the widest layout the worst case reads as the conservative choice and is the
 * exact opposite of one: it yields 44px at 1120 and less at every width below
 * — 30px at 768, 15px at 390 — so it fails 2.5.8 on every phone, i.e. on
 * precisely the devices a minimum tap target exists for. If a later PR is
 * tempted to simplify this back to a constant, that is the arithmetic it has
 * to answer, and `CountryLevel.markers.test.tsx` asserts it at three widths.
 *
 * `renderedWidth` must be positive; `useRenderedWidth` is what guarantees it,
 * by reporting an unmeasurable container as null rather than as 0.
 *
 * `WorldMap`'s docblock converts the same way when it calls its 9-unit hit
 * circle "~22px at desktop" — and reaches the opposite conclusion for the
 * world level, where a compliant circle would swallow San Marino's neighbours
 * outright. At country level the same collision is possible between two
 * cities, so this is a ceiling and `nonOverlappingRadii` is what enforces it.
 * The narrower the screen the harder that cap bites, which is the trade §5.2's
 * list is there to make acceptable.
 *
 * At `k` = 1, for the reason the marker constants above are, and divided by
 * `k` at its use site like every one of them: a magnified map draws the same
 * radius over `k` times as many CSS pixels, so `/ k` is what keeps the target
 * 44px rather than 44k. It is the MEASUREMENT that is divided —
 * `tapTargetRadius(renderedWidth) / k`, never `TAP_MIN_R_FALLBACK / k` —
 * because a zoomed phone needs three times the radius a zoomed desktop does,
 * exactly as an unzoomed one does.
