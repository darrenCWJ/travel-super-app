/**
 * The country level every country that is not China renders (spec §5).
 *
 * A separate file from `ChinaLevel` rather than a generalisation of it, and
 * deliberately: `ChinaLevel` carries the seven curated regions, the nine-dash
 * line and China's own region zoom, none of which any other country has. §9.5
 * requires China's rendered output to be byte-identical across this phase, and
 * the cheapest way to guarantee that is for this work to never touch the code
 * path that draws it.
 *
 * This level now has a region zoom of its own, and that is convergence rather
 * than duplication: `regionSchemeFor` answers "what are this country's regions"
 * for all 246, and China's seven are one of its answers. What is not shared is
 * the DRAWING, which is the half §9.5 pins.
 *
 * Four things here are load-bearing.
 *
 * **The outline is `merge()` over the very units the picker lists**, not a
 * second asset (§4.1). One fetch feeds both, and the seams between units
 * dissolve because they share arcs — a country whose units were separate
 * polygons would draw its internal borders twice, once as a unit edge and once
 * as coastline.
 *
 * **The frame comes from the manifest, not from a fit over what happened to
 * load.** `public/country-projections.json` is where the §5.4 trim decisions
 * live — the nine countries whose outlying polygons are deliberately out of
 * frame — and a per-render `fitExtent` would silently overrule every one of
 * them, putting Clipperton back in France's viewport and shrinking the country
 * anyone actually plans in by a factor of six. The fit remains as the fallback
 * for a country with no entry, because the manifest and the code deploy
 * independently.
 *
 * **The list beside the map is not decoration.** §5.2 makes it the source of
 * truth for the accessibility tree and §12.2 gates the phase on it: the map
 * must never become the only way to select a place. The markers now carry a
 * keyboard model of their own (§5.3.1) and are in the accessibility tree
 * because of it, so each place is two controls — a marker and a list chip.
 * That is deliberate and it is not duplication for its own sake: the marker
 * layer costs ONE tab stop however many places it draws, and the list is what
 * reaches a place the §5.4 trim left outside the viewport.
 *
 * **Activating a marker opens a card, and the modality it was activated with
 * decides where focus goes.** `SelectedPlaceCard` (§5.3.3) is the surface
 * `PlacePopup` cannot be — the popup is a `pointer-events-none` tooltip
 * positioned from mouse events alone, so on a touch screen it never opens and
 * on any screen nothing inside it can be operated. Hover keeps going to the
 * popup, untouched; tap and Enter open the card. The `viaKeyboard` flag
 * threaded through `useMarkerSelection` exists for exactly one reason: focus
 * follows a keyboard activation into the card and comes back on dismiss, and
 * does not move for a pointer one.
 *
 * **`readOnly` is a mode, and it exists because a noop callback is not one.**
 * `RouteMap` draws an itinerary that already exists (§2.1) and has always
 * passed `noop` for the toggle. Every control above still rendered against
 * it: a marker announcing `role="button"` and `aria-pressed`, holding a tab
 * stop, opening a card whose primary button reads "Remove <name> from trip" —
 * on a surface where none of it can change anything. The damage is in the
 * ANNOUNCEMENT as much as in the dead callback, so the mode is what the
 * markers are built from rather than a guard inside `activate`: read-only
 * markers are a drawing of the plan, with no role, no tab stop and no card.
 * Hover is untouched, because a tooltip describes without offering.

            Unconditional, and identity until a region is chosen. A wrapper
            mounted only while zoomed would remount every marker under it on
            each zoom — taking `useMarkerSelection`'s node refs, the roving tab
            stop and whatever the caret was on with them — and would give the
            transition nothing to animate from, since a node created with its
            final transform has no previous value to leave.

            A CSS transform rather than the SVG attribute, because it is the
            one that transitions, and `transformOrigin: 0 0` because the
            translate is computed about the viewBox origin. `ChinaLevel` frames
            its regions exactly this way.
