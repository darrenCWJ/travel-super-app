/**
 * Country level of the two-level picker (spec §6), and now only the dispatcher
 * for it: a country with an admin-1 file renders `CountryLevel` over it, and a
 * country whose geometry has not arrived renders the list alone.
 *
 * It used to be a three-way dispatch, with China routed to a `ChinaLevel` of
 * its own — a second renderer over a second asset (`public/china-provinces.json`)
 * whose zoom level was China's seven curated regions rather than admin-1.
 * That made China the one country answering to a different control than the
 * other 245, in an app whose whole direction is worldwide, and it is why
 * China alone had no province picker and no airport layer: both were gated on
 * `!hasCurated`.
 *
 * China now takes this path like everyone else, over `public/provinces/CN.json`
 * — which §6.3 already specified as a re-envelope of the same curated topology,
 * Chinese names, `adcode` join key, nine-dash line and all. The seven regions
 * are not gone; they moved to where they carry meaning. `REGION_MONTHS` is
 * still keyed by them and `mapTypes.isChinaPlace` still reads a Chinese city's
 * climate off them (§6.4: "preserved verbatim"). What they stopped being is
 * the map's zoom level.

   * `REGION_META` compiles clean and throws at render. The union below at

   * would go on compiling and stop meaning anything.
