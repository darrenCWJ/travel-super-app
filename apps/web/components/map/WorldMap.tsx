/**
 * World level of the two-level picker (spec §6): every country as a selectable
 * feature, tinted by its own accent.
 *
 * Four things are load-bearing here.
 *
 * **The topology is fetched on mount, and nowhere else.** Spec §6 requires the
 * 730KB asset to load only once the picker opens, which this satisfies by
 * fetching from inside the component the picker mounts — so "when does it load"
 * has exactly one answer, and the consumer's `next/dynamic` import keeps the
 * parse cost off the same page too. Nothing here runs on a route that never
 * shows a map.
 *
 * **Colour comes only from `lib/accent` and the token set.** Each country is
 * filled with its own `fill`-role accent, which is what makes 235 countries
 * distinguishable without a hand-picked palette; strokes and the water are
 * tokens. There is no hex literal in this file, deliberately (spec §4.1/§4.2).
 *
 * **Small countries are selected through the point layer, not their polygon.**
 * A country below the area threshold is one pixel of polygon at world zoom, so
 * `smallCountries` carries a centroid and it gets a circle. Its polygon still
 * draws, but inert — one country must not be two competing hit targets.
 *
 * **The A–Z list, not the circle, is the target that meets `--tap-min`.**
 * `POINT_HIT_R` cannot be raised to reach it. A 44px-equivalent circle is
 * r ≈ 17.5 viewBox units at the width `/plan` renders, and San Marino and
 * Vatican City sit ~6 units apart at this fit — so the circle would swallow its
 * neighbours, and around Singapore it would swallow Johor, because the point
 * layer draws on top of every polygon. The compliant target therefore has to be
 * a *second* control rather than a bigger one, which is also what spec §6 asks
 * for: "search remains the guaranteed path to every country". `PlaceSearch`
 * searches within the country already chosen and cannot change it, so the
 * picker below the map is that path. It costs one tab stop, not 235.
