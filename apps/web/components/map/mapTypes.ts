 *      for exactly this reason — and a `Map` closes it by construction rather
 *      than by remembering to guard every read.
 *   2. **Not a function.** A `(id: string) => DerivedClimate | undefined`
 *      would let a caller hand in a closure that fetches, memoises or
 *      otherwise does work at render time. The rule this seam exists to obey
 *      is that the fit resolution stays *synchronous over rows already in
 *      hand*. `lib/countryFacts.test.ts` is not what enforces that here —
 *      its walk targets one artifact, `lib/countryFacts.ts`, checked for
 *      reachability from a fixed nine-module `MUST_STAY_CHEAP` list, and
 *      `components/map/mapTypes.ts` is not on it, so that test is silent
 *      about this file. The rule stands on the design alone: rows have to
 *      arrive by `fetch`, from the component, and be passed down already in
 *      hand. Inert data cannot break that; a callback can.
 *   3. **`Readonly`.** The join belongs to the caller, which memoises it
 *      across renders; nothing here may mutate it.

/**
 * A region id → the verdict for the month being asked about, for regions

 * verdict — mean penalty, modal band, population weighting — is undecided;
 * Plan 6 (decision P6-1) declined to build a province tint, so this seam has
 * no caller. This type only says that the answer would arrive already
 * computed, so `fitForRegion` stays synchronous and holds no opinion.
 *
 * Keyed by `regionScheme.RegionId`, which is `string` because the ids come out
 * of a data file. Same `ReadonlyMap` reasoning as `DerivedClimateIndex`.
 *
 * **It cannot enforce §9.5 by itself, and it does not try.** `fitForRegion`
 * receives a region id and nothing else — no country — so the China check in
 * front of this lookup is the string test, which the seven admin-1 names in
 * `MapPlace.region`'s docblock are known to pass from five other countries.
 * That is safe here only because the entries are the caller's own: a caller
 * that is rendering Botswana can only ever have put Botswana's regions in it.
 *
 * **The corollary is not "do not build one of these for China" — that framing
 * is wrong.** Nothing about `DerivedRegionFits` is unsafe *for China
 * specifically*; what is unsafe is keying it, or calling `fitForRegion`, with
 * the wrong string. The rule is: **key it by `RegionGroup.id`, never by
 * `MapPlace.region`.** `RegionGroup.id` (`lib/regionScheme.ts`) is the
 * Natural Earth `adm1_code` the third map level actually zooms on —
 * `"BWA-1191"`, `"PER-1"` — while `MapPlace.region` is the human-readable
 * admin-1 name, and for Botswana that name is literally `"Central"`. A caller
 * that keyed this lookup, or called `fitForRegion`, with `place.region` would
 * hit `isChinaRegion("Central") === true` above and render Chongqing's table
 * for a Botswana region — the same leak `MapPlace.region` was fixed for once
 * already, at the place level, in commit 1407502. `RegionGroup.id` cannot
 * collide that way: measured over every committed file in `public/provinces/`,
 * 0 of the 4,592 admin-1 unit ids equal any of China's seven region names,
 * which is what makes keying by `RegionGroup.id` safe today. It is also why
 * the *place* branch is gated on the country instead (see `fitForPlace`),
 * where the country is actually available and this id question does not
 * arise the same way.

 * `regionFit` and §9.5's last paragraph explicitly forbids placing it in
 * `fitForPlace`; the two cannot both be honoured, because `regionFit` receives
 * a region label and a month and the derived artifact is keyed **per city**.
 * `fitForPlace` is the only one of the pair that holds a `MapPlace`, so it is
 * the only one that knows which city — and the only one that can be given a

 * gives that by construction rather than by ordering luck.
 *
 * **Why the China step is gated on `place.country` and not `isChinaPlace`.**
 * `isChinaPlace` also requires the region to be one of China's seven, and
 * measured over `public/cities/CN.json` **not one of its 412 rows satisfies
 * that** — their admin-1 names are "Sichuan", "Guangdong", "Beijing". Gating

 * success test ("China's rendered output is byte-identical") exists to catch.

 * derived row for a Chinese city is simply ignored. A Chinese place outside

 * `REGION_MONTHS[region][12]` is `undefined` and `.fit` on it is a TypeError,

 * inherits it rather than adding a second rule. `monthFit` likewise throws on
