/**
 * Hero band for a country: a Commons photograph where one exists, the accent
 * gradient where none does, and — either way — a scrim between the background
 * and whatever the caller renders on top (spec §4.4).
 *
 * Three things are load-bearing here.
 *
 * **The scrim is an element, and it is never conditional.** Not a class on the
 * band, not a modifier applied when an image happens to be present: a sibling
 * that always renders, always between the background layers and the content.
 * The rule the spec states is that contrast holds *regardless of which image is
 * returned* (§4.4 rule 1) — a scrim that depends on the image cannot make that
 * promise, and neither can one whose absence is a class name someone can drop
 * while restyling. `data-scrim` is how the test names it.
 *
 * **The band's own background belongs to the caller**, and it is the ground a
 * photograph falls back to — while it loads, if Commons blocks the hotlink, or
 * if the URL fails the scheme check below. Pass an opaque, dark-enough one:
 * everything above the scrim is light text by construction.
 *
 * **Attribution is not optional either.** `ImageCredit` cannot be minted
 * outside `lib/countryImagery`, so an image hero always carries one and this
 * component always renders it. The gradient path renders none because there is
 * nothing to attribute, which is the only reason the credit line is conditional
 * where the scrim is not.
 */

/**
 * Flat scrim across the whole band, plus more of it towards the bottom.
 *
 * Two layers of one token rather than a `color-mix` of it: the flat layer is
 * what protects text at the *top* of the band (an eyebrow and a heading, in
 * both mount points), and a gradient alone fades to nothing exactly there.
