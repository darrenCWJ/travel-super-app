        Beside the footer, not inside it — and NOT inside DestinationStep alone.

        Two separate reasons stack here. DestinationStep is mounted under
        `{step === 1 && (`, so step 0 and the generated plan on step 2 would
        carry no credit at all, and step 2 is full of GeoNames city names, day
        counts and route legs. And the footer above is `print:hidden`, while the
        app has its own "Print / save as PDF" button in components/PlanStep.tsx
        — so a credit nested in that footer is absent from the one artifact a
        traveller actually carries around. `display: none` on the footer wins
        over any `print:block` written on a descendant, so the fix is to be a
        sibling of the footer rather than a child of it.

        lib/contracts.test.ts (C7) scans for a `<GeoNamesCredit` that sits
        inside a `print:hidden` container, so moving it back fails CI.
