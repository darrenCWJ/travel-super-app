/**
 * WCAG 2.2 AA 2.5.8, measured instead of computed.
 *
 * This is the spec the project did not have and most needed. Every tap-target
 * assertion in the 2,368-test unit suite runs in jsdom, which computes NO
 * layout: `getBoundingClientRect` is all zeroes there and CSS variables are
 * strings nothing resolves. So the suite asserts either an `r` attribute
 * against a number the test derived itself, or — worse — that a CLASS NAME is
 * present. `expect(chip.className).toContain("min-h-[var(--tap-min)]")` passes
 * whether or not `--tap-min` exists, resolves, or applies to that display type.
 *
 * The first run of this file found a control that was 24px tall for exactly
 * that reason (the map/cards view toggle, which had no size class at all).
 *
 * Runs at a phone width (Pixel 5, 393 CSS px) because that is the claim: a
 * control that clears 44px at 1120px can be half that on a phone, and the
 * phone is where the standard applies.
