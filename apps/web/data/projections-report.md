## Coverage

- Entries: **246**
- Countries drawn from more than one polygon: **150**
- Countries rotated off the antimeridian: **5**
- Countries whose fit leaves a polygon out of frame: **9**
- Multi-polygon countries the gates refused to trim: **141**
- Largest hidden area: **0.890%**

The nine trims below are far fewer, and far smaller, than the spec
predicted — and the reason is not cartographic. The spec's headline case
was the Netherlands at 11.51x, hiding Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius;
those three are now `BQ.json`, a country of their own, so there is no
longer a Dutch polygon for a projection to hide. New Zealand went the same
way when Tokelau became `TK.json`. A cartographic workaround was retired
by a data-model decision, and anyone comparing this table against the
spec's should read the difference as the territory policy working rather
than as the rule disagreeing.

## Rotations

Rule 1: everyone else takes `rotate: 0`. These cross the antimeridian,
where an unrotated fit reads a 3-degree-wide country as a 357-degree one
and collapses.

## Trims accepted

Gate A: at most 1% of the country hidden. Gate B: separation at least 0.5,
as centroid distance in degrees over the anchor's own bbox diagonal. Gate
C: the country must draw at least 1.5x bigger for the loss to be worth it.
