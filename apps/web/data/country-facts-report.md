**246 countries carry at least one fact.**

Every record also carries the country's English NAME, from the item's own
`rdfs:label`. It is identity rather than a fact — it is what the sentences in
`lib/countryTips.ts` call the country — so it is not counted as one, and a record
carrying nothing but a name would be omitted exactly like an empty one.

A country with none is absent from the artifact entirely and falls through to
`lib/countryProfile.ts`'s neutral profile, which is the honest default. A field
with no supporting data is ABSENT from its record — never an empty string, never
an empty array, never a placeholder — and the template that would render it
simply does not run.

## Coverage by field

## Countries by rendered-field count

Of the seven fields that reach a traveller. A country lower down this table is
not a country we got wrong — it is one whose gap note names, per field, exactly
what we do not have.

## Not derivable

Recorded so it is not re-litigated. Each of these was measured, not assumed.

- **Rail speed outside China.** Wikidata's "high-speed railway line" class returns
  lines for Peru, Panama, Ecuador, Bangladesh, Venezuela, Colombia, Australia and
  the Philippines. Either that or the World Bank's route-kilometre series would
  tell the app Peru is high-speed-rail friendly. Rail speed for a new country is a
  hand-written, cited entry in `lib/countryData/`.
- **Public holidays.** The open dataset with the best coverage reaches 204 of 246
  and misses IN, TH, MY, LK, NP, PK, MM, LA, IL, AE, SA, QA, KW, OM, JO, LB, TW,
  MO, MU, MV, FJ, UZ, IR, AZ and 18 more — disproportionately where holiday
  crowding matters most. It returns single dates rather than travel-impact bands.
  Wikidata's own holiday property reaches 73 of 246.
- **Per-month crowd pressure.** No open per-country per-month tourism seasonality
  source exists at this granularity.
- **Climate normals.** These need station data of a different order of size, and
  they are the highest-value future addition — climate is what actually answers
  "when should I go".
- **A currency NAME a traveller could be shown.** The code is carried and rendered;
  the name is carried and never rendered. Measured 2026-08-27 on the currency items
  themselves: PE's is `Nuevo sol`, the pre-2015 name Peru dropped that year, and the
  `mul` fallback does not fix it (Q204656 has an English label and no `mul` one).
  Nor is the field consistent in what it names — JP's is `yen` and MX's is `peso`,
  generic units rather than the Japanese yen or the Mexican peso — and P1813
  ("short name") is empty for every one sampled, so no better property exists to
  switch to. One label being provably stale while 238 more are unchecked is not a
  one-country correction; it is a field that cannot be shown. See the block comment
  in `lib/countryFacts.ts`.
- **Payment apps, connectivity, booking channels, tipping, tap water, visa rules.**
  No structured source. Visa rules also depend on the traveller's passport, which
  the app does not know.
- **Official languages for 7 of the 246 countries.**
  The gap note names the field for every one of them. Both the list and the split below
  are derived from this run rather than written down, so neither can drift from what was
  actually published:
  AF, BQ, GP, MQ, PW, US, UY
  - **4 because every P37 statement upstream gives them is qualified
    `applies to part`** — or enough of them that the remainder is not a national list.
    Upstream is stating, on the statement itself, that this is not a claim about the
    whole country. The United States is the case that forces the rule: Carolinian and
    Chamorro apply to the Northern Marianas, Hawaiian to Hawaii, Samoan to American
    Samoa and Spanish to Puerto Rico, while English sits at deprecated rank — so an
    unfiltered query told a traveller the United States has five official languages and
    none of them is English. Publishing the unscoped remainder instead was measured and
    rejected: it leaves Azerbaijan with `Azerbaijani Sign Language` alone, trading one
    false sentence for another. Where the qualifier names a PART of the country
    (Belgium's language regions) or a VARIETY of the language (Standard Azerbaijani)
    rather than a territory the national claim excludes, a hand-verified value is
    carried instead and the whole field is not lost — see `CURATED_FACTS`.
    AF, BQ, PW, US
  - **3 because upstream states no official language at all** —
    no truthy P37 statement, or none this ingest can publish.
    GP, MQ, UY
- **1 official-language statement upstream makes, refused by hand.**
  Each was checked against a primary source and found false, and is refused by Q-id
  for that one country, so the rest of its list still publishes. The provenance of
  each is recorded beside it in `REFUSED_LANGUAGE_ITEMS`. Derived from this run, as
  country.Q-id:
  MR.Q150
- **Plug letters for the fifteen BS 546 countries.** Measured 2026-08-27: the whole
  distinct P2853 value set across these countries is fourteen items, thirteen
  standards plus one Wikipedia article. One of the thirteen, `BS 546`, is a single
  Wikidata item covering both of its sizes — the 5 A variant is IEC type D and the
  15 A variant is type M — and the statement carries nothing that separates them.
  Guessing D would publish "South Africa uses type C/D/N" when South Africa's
  round-pin sockets are the 15 A type M, and a traveller who buys a type D adapter
  on that sentence finds it does not fit. So the whole plug field is withheld for
  MO, BT, MZ, PK, IL, PS, ZA, IN, BW, LK, NP, SZ, NG, NA and LS, and the gap note
  names it. Splitting the item upstream, or a qualifier that gives the current
  rating, is what would fix this.
- **Anything about a country the app has no city shard for.** The query is bounded
  to the 246 codes under `public/cities`. Measured 2026-08-27, an unbounded P297
  query answers with 259: the extra thirteen are AC, AN, AQ, BV, CP, CQ, DD, DG,
  HM, PC, TA, UM and YU — exceptionally reserved codes, uninhabited territories,
  and the historical Netherlands Antilles, East Germany and Yugoslavia. Facts about
  East Germany would pass every gate in the ingest and answer a question no user
  can ask.

## Attribution

Wikidata's main and property namespaces are CC0 — a public domain dedication with
NO attribution condition to discharge. **No UI credit is added for this source,
and that is a decision rather than an oversight.**

`components/plan/GeoNamesCredit.tsx` already argues this exact case for this exact
source in its own doc-comment: naming a CC0 source inside a legal notice would
imply the credits beside it are discretionary, when every one of them is required.
Adding one here would weaken the notice.

This file is therefore deliberately outside the C7 derived contract in
`lib/contracts.test.ts`, which names `data/cities-report.md` specifically. If a
future task adds a source that DOES carry an attribution condition, that task owns,
in a single commit: the clause in `GeoNamesCredit.tsx`, the C7 token-list widening,
and the enumerated-surface update in `data/cities-report.md`.
