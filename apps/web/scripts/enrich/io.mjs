/**
 * enrich-cities — the network and filesystem edges: the retrying fetch, the
 * two upstreams it drives, the atomic write and the JSON read.
 *
 * Moved verbatim out of scripts/enrich-cities.mjs on 2026-09-07 (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) so that file stays under the 800-line
 * guidance; every docblock below is that file's, and the enrichment it
 * describes is unchanged. The entry point — `run`, the run guard — is still
 * scripts/enrich-cities.mjs.
 *
 * The endpoints, the timeouts, the retry delays and the two politeness sleeps
 * came with the code that reads them; they were declared above the `Pure`
 * banner in the file this was cut from, and nothing outside these functions
 * reads them. Nothing here computes a path from `import.meta.url`, so sitting
 * one directory deeper costs this file nothing: `run` still passes
 * `targetsPath` and `enrichDir` in, which is what lets a test drive the real
 * plan-then-gate-then-write ordering without touching Wikidata or
 * `public/cities/`.
 *
 * Changed since the move, on 2026-09-23: `USER_AGENT`, with a docblock of its
 * own saying why, and `fetchWithRetry`, which now attaches it to every request
 * itself rather than trusting each caller to pass it; the last paragraph of
 * its docblock is new too.
