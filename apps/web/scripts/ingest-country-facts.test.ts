/**
 * Covers `run()` — the seam between the pure build and its network and
 * filesystem edges — and through it every branch of the gate by BEHAVIOUR
 * rather than by source position. The module's entry-point guard means
 * importing it here does not also run the ingest.
 *
 * The pure functions `run()` composes were moved into scripts/country-facts/
 * on 2026-09-07 (spec 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) and their describes
 * went with them: parse.test.ts, picks.test.ts, curated.test.ts, facts.test.ts,
 * gate.test.ts, io.test.ts and report.test.ts. Every describe below is this
 * file's own, unchanged.
 *
 * No network call is made anywhere in this file. Every upstream answer is a
 * fixture and `run()` is driven with an injected loader.
 *
 * The upstream shapes below are the ones Investigation 3 MEASURED on
 * 2026-08-27 — `BZ 550/220`, `FR 400/230`, `NL EUR/USD/AWG/XCG`,
 * `CZ CZK/203`, `PL PLN/PLZ`, `ZW` x13, and Q60740126 across 39 countries —
 * not shapes invented to make a rule look reachable. A withhold rule tested
 * only against a fixture nobody ever saw upstream proves the code compiles,
 * not that it defends anything.
 *
 * Nothing below declares a fixture or a feed helper. `PLUG_ITEM`,
 * `PLUG_ARTICLE`, `entity`, `FILLER_POOL` and `SAMPLE_GROWTH_GAIN` come from
 * scripts/country-facts/fixtures.ts, and the whole-feed apparatus the
 * describes drive — `healthyFeed`, `addCountry`, `FILLER_SPEC`, `FILLERS`,
 * `dropRows`, `languageItem` and the `Feed` type — from
 * scripts/country-facts/runHarness.ts, both their single home since
 * 2026-09-07. What stays here is what cannot leave a test file: the
 * `vi.mock("node:fs")` hoist, the lifecycle hooks, and the helpers that read
 * the mocked write primitives.
 *
 * `the four withhold rules are observably live on a whole feed` moved to
 * scripts/country-facts/gate.test.ts on the same day, where the split's table
 * always put it; it never called `run()`, only the feed apparatus that is now
 * importable.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// run() — proving the gate by behaviour, not by source position
//
// The design forbids a source-position grep test here, and the preamble to
// scripts/ingest-cities.test.ts's `run() aborts before any write primitive
// fires when assertSane rejects the feed` records why: a reviewer
// mutation-tested that shape and found four changes that leave it green while
// a corrupt feed still reaches disk — a gate hidden behind a never-set env
// flag, a write hoisted above the gate, an early-return branch that writes
// before returning, and a try/catch that swallows the gate's exception.
//
// This block drives the real, exported `run()` with injected loaders and
// asserts by BEHAVIOUR: on a rejected feed no write primitive ever fires and
// the output directory is never even created. Every one of those four
// mutations turns at least one test below red.
//
// The positive control at the top is what keeps the rest from passing
// vacuously: a harness that could never write would satisfy every
// `not.toHaveBeenCalled()` in the file.
