/**
 * ingest-country-facts.mjs
 *
 * Builds data/country-facts.json — structured scalars about every country the
 * app ships a city shard for — from Wikidata's SPARQL endpoint, plus
 * data/country-facts-report.md describing what was and was not derivable.
 *
 * STRUCTURED SCALARS ONLY, NEVER PROSE. The country's English name, currency
 * code and name, plug letters, mains voltage, driving side, emergency numbers
 * with their roles, official languages, dialling code and a centroid latitude
 * used by one cross-check.
 *
 * The NAME is identity, not a fact, and the difference is enforced rather than
 * asserted: it sits in `RECORD_FIELDS` so every shape rule applies to it, and
 * it is deliberately absent from `FACT_FIELDS` so `factCount` - the unit every
 * drift check in this file counts in - does not move by 246 the night this
 * field was added. It exists because the sentences in lib/countryTips.ts have
 * to name the country ("We don't have Peru-specific guidance...") and
 * lib/countries.ts's hand-tuned table covers 24 of the 246: the other 222 read
 * "We don't have PE-specific guidance..." without it. Hand-writing 246 names
 * was the alternative, and it is the thing the honest-gap rule exists to
 * refuse - so the name comes from the same CC0 source, under the same gates,
 * as every other value here.
 * The sentences a traveller reads are written by hand in reviewed TypeScript
 * (lib/countryTips.ts, Task 26) from these scalars; no upstream string is ever
 * rendered as advice. The artifact is called `country-facts`, not
 * `country-guidance`, and that name is a guardrail: it should read as wrong to
 * put a sentence in it.
 *
 * Why an ingest at all: lib/countryProfile.ts already declares the right
 * interface and the plan generators already route through it, but outside
 * China it answers with the neutral defaults. That is honest and thin. These
 * facts turn thin into specific for 246 countries without anybody hand-writing
 * 246 country guides — and a field with no supporting data emits NOTHING
 * rather than a hedge, a placeholder or a guess.
 *
 * Rerunnable and idempotent: `stampedPayload` keeps the previous
 * `generatedAt` when the payload is unchanged, so a quiet night produces a
 * byte-identical file and the nightly workflow has nothing to commit. There is
 * no per-country write loop — the whole merge is computed in memory, every
 * gate runs, and only then does a single whole-file write happen.
 *
 * Like ingest-cities.mjs and ingest-airports.mjs, and unlike
 * ingest-destinations.mjs, this script ABORTS BEFORE WRITING when a sanity
 * check fails. The nightly workflow commits what this writes and Vercel
 * deploys the commit unattended. Task 7 of this project shipped a measured
 * data wipe because an HTTP 200 with a short body was treated as a full
 * answer: it deleted 2,559 of 5,118 records in one night at exit 0. A corrupt
 * facts artifact is not useful for inspection, it is a production incident, so
 * `assertFactsSane` runs before `mkdirSync` and before any write primitive
 * fires.
 *
 * Licence: Wikidata's main and property namespaces are CC0 — a public domain
 * dedication with NO attribution condition. That is confirmed live from the
 * endpoint's own `meta=siteinfo` and it is why this source adds nothing to
 * components/plan/GeoNamesCredit.tsx and nothing to lib/contracts.test.ts's C7
 * contract. That component's own doc-comment argues this exact case for this
 * exact source: naming a CC0 source in a legal notice would imply the credits
 * beside it are discretionary, when every one of them is required. The
 * decision is recorded in three coupled places so a reader cannot mistake it
 * for an oversight — `SOURCE_LICENSE` in scripts/country-facts/io.mjs, the
 * `license` field stamped into the artifact envelope, and the `## Attribution`
 * section of the report.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs
 *
 * To write a language change a human has reviewed — the nightly job never
 * does; see scripts/country-facts/languages.mjs:
 *
 *   CIP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE_CHANGES=IQ,MR node scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs
 *
 * That inline form is bash / Git Bash syntax. In PowerShell, set and clear
 * the variable around the one command instead, so it cannot outlive it:
 *
 *   try { $env:CIP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE_CHANGES = 'IQ,MR'; node scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs } finally { Remove-Item Env:CIP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE_CHANGES }
 *
 * Whichever shell you use, never set it in a way that outlives the command —
 * a bare `$env:...=` or an `export` in bash: the acceptance only checks that
 * a listed country changed this run, not that the change matches what was
 * reviewed, so a value that stays armed would wave a second, different
 * change to the same country through in a later run unreviewed.
 *
 * Everything this file used to hold below `run()`'s section banner was moved
 * verbatim into scripts/country-facts/ on 2026-09-07 (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) so this file stays under the 800-line
 * guidance: `parse.mjs`, `picks.mjs`, `curated.mjs`, `facts.mjs`, `gate.mjs`,
 * `io.mjs` and `report.mjs`, one per section banner. Nothing about the build
 * changed with them, and `assertFactsSane` — now `gate.mjs`'s — still runs
 * here before `mkdirSync` and before any write primitive fires.
 *
 * This script imports nothing outside node:fs, node:path, node:url and its own
 * scripts/country-facts/ modules. It deliberately reads no `lib/*.ts` leaf:
 * build-time logic may not live in lib/, which is also why `writeFileAtomic`
 * in scripts/country-facts/io.mjs is an acknowledged fourth verbatim copy
 * rather than a shared import. If a future edit does need a leaf, it must be a
 * zero-import one and the import must carry an explicit `.ts` extension —
 * Node's native type stripping (stable since Node 22.18 / 24) fails an
 * extensionless `.ts` -> `.ts` import with ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND, and adding
 * the extension inside lib/ fails `tsc` with TS5097.

/**
 * Everything `node scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs` does, minus the entry
 * guard.
 *
 * `fetchBindings` and `dataDir` are injectable so a test can drive the real
 * build-then-gate-then-write ordering end to end — fake upstream answers in,
 * real `assertFactsSane`, real `writeFileAtomic` calls out — without touching
 * Wikidata or `data/`. That is the only way to pin a gate's CALL SITE:
 * scripts/enrich-cities.mjs's `assertEnrichmentSane` had its body fully tested
 * while deleting the one line that invoked it left the suite green and
 * produced a complete wipe at exit 0. The entry guard below passes only
 * `acceptLanguageChanges`, read from the environment there and nowhere else;
 * every other parameter defaults to the real implementation.
 *
 * `acceptLanguageChanges` is the raw `CIP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE_CHANGES` value
 * (scripts/country-facts/languages.mjs): the countries whose language change
 * a human reviewed. It is parsed before anything else happens — a typo in it
 * is a typo in a command a human is running, and it must stop the run before
 * the previous artifact is read or a single request is made. It defaults to
 * NONE rather than to `process.env`, so a variable exported in a developer's
 * shell can never leak into the `run()` tests.
 *
 * `mkdirSync` sits BELOW the gate, unlike scripts/ingest-cities.mjs where it
 * runs first (a tracked finding recorded in scripts/ingest-cities.test.ts's
 * `run() aborts before any write primitive fires when assertSane rejects the
 * feed`). A rejected run must leave no trace at all, and a directory created
 * before the gate is one — which also makes "nothing was written" checkable by
 * a test rather than merely asserted here.
