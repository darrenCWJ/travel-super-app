/**
 * The §5.4 projection rule: how each of the 246 countries is fitted into the
 * map viewport, and which of its outlying polygons may be left out of frame.
 *
 * Builds public/country-projections.json and data/projections-report.md from
 * the committed province files, whose units `merge()` into each country's
 * outline (spec §4.1) — so one artifact feeds both the fit and the drawing.
 *
 * Run by hand and the output committed:
 *
 *     node scripts/build-projections.mjs
 *
 * Modelled on build-provinces.mjs: every gate fires before any write, the pure
 * functions are exported for tests and the I/O is not, and an entry-point
 * guard keeps an import from rewriting the manifest.
 *
 * Two things about this file are load-bearing and neither is obvious:
 *
 * 1. **The viewport comes from lib/mapView.ts, never a literal.** The spec's
 *    own committed manifest was computed against 860x600 while the app renders
 *    into 860x620, so every scale in it is wrong by 3.3% and the build-time
 *    test §5.4 describes would fail on all of them.
 * 2. **d3-geo reads rings spherically.** A ring wound the other way is the
 *    globe MINUS the shape, which is why the fit uses a `MultiPoint` and never
 *    a `Polygon` rectangle (§5.5), and why `separation`'s fixtures have to be
 *    wound the way `merge()` winds real outlines.
