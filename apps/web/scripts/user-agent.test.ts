/**
 * Every outbound User-Agent in the tree says who is calling and how to reach
 * them.
 *
 * Wikimedia's User-Agent policy
 * (https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:User-Agent_policy, moved there
 * from meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_policy) asks every client for
 * contact information — an email address, a website or a wiki user — and says
 * a missing, empty or generic one gets HTTP 403. On 2026-09-23, from the
 * owner's machine, query.wikidata.org and
 * www.wikidata.org both answered HTTP 403 "Please respect our robot policy" to
 * the bare `ChinaItineraryPlanner/1.0 (personal project)` this repo then sent
 * from nine files, and 200 to the identical request carrying a contact URL.
 *
 * The enforcement is not constant — the nightly runners were answered normally
 * that day, and so was the same machine a few hours later — which is why this
 * is pinned in source rather than left to be noticed. Where it would be noticed
 * is the problem: the refresh's P297 `codes` query is fatal by design (see
 * `run()` in scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs), so the first night enforcement
 * reached a runner would be a red refresh; and lib/server/cityEnrichment.ts
 * fails silently by design, so there it would be nothing but thinner cards.
 *
 * The form is scripts/build-provinces.mjs's, the first compliant one here: a
 * per-script product token, then the public repo's URL. Never anyone's email
 * address — the repo is public, and so is every header sent from it. The
 * User-Agents sent to hosts that are not Wikimedia's (GeoNames, OurAirports,
 * jsDelivr, CHELSA, GitHub) take the same form, so there is one shape to copy
 * and no file left to copy the old one from. Two server-side fetches send none
 * at all — lib/server/catalog.ts's to GitHub, and lib/rates.ts's
 * `fetchJsonWithTimeout` — and nothing here requires one of them, since
 * neither is a Wikimedia caller.
 *
 * Blunt in lib/contracts.test.ts's sense: it reads source as text. That file's
 * harness is not reused because it does not scan `.mjs`, which is every script
 * here, and widening it would widen C1–C8 with it. The constants stay one per
 * file rather than shared, for the reason scripts/country-facts/io.mjs gives
 * `writeFileAtomic`: a scripts/ helper module would be an import edge for one
 * line, and lib/ may not import from scripts/ at all.
