 * No "N countries changed tonight" line, deliberately, for the reason
 * scripts/ingest-cities.mjs's `buildReport` gives: that number is 246 on a
 * first run and 0 on a quiet one, which would make this committed file differ
 * every time the previous run's numbers differed. Everything below is a pure
 * function of the records, so a rebuild with no data change produces a
 * byte-identical report and `git status` stays clean.
 *
 * `scopedLanguages` is the one input that is NOT a record, and it is still not
 * a run count: it is `diagnostics.scopedLanguages`, the set of countries whose
 * P37 statements upstream qualified `applies to part`. Same query, same
 * answer, same output — see `languageGap` below for why the alternative was a
 * literal that drifted, and for what `null` means.
 *
 * `refusedLanguages` is the second such input, `diagnostics.refusedFired`, and
 * `null` means the same thing — see `refusalNote` below.
