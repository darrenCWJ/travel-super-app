/**
 * ingest-country-facts — the whole-feed apparatus the behavioural tests drive.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts`: vitest.config.mts includes `scripts/**\/*.test.ts`, so
 * this file is imported by the suites and never collected as one of them. It
 * declares no `describe`, no `test` and no lifecycle hook, so importing it
 * registers nothing — `vi.mock("node:fs")`, `beforeEach`/`afterEach`/
 * `beforeAll` and every helper that touches the mocked write primitives stay in
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts, where hoisting and hook registration
 * are per-file and have to be.
 *
 * Every declaration below is a VERBATIM move, on 2026-09-07, out of
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts — `git show
 * HEAD:scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts` lines 2150–2346 (`Feed` through
 * `healthyFeed`) and 2421–2426 (`dropRows`), in that order. The bodies are
 * unchanged; only `export ` was added to the seven declarations read from
 * outside. It was moved because `the four withhold rules are observably live
 * on a whole feed` belongs in scripts/country-facts/gate.test.ts (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) and is built entirely from this
 * apparatus: leaving the apparatus in the entry test would have meant a
 * 197-line byte-identical second copy in gate.test.ts, which is the exact
 * duplication scripts/country-facts/fixtures.ts exists to end.
 *
 * The fixtures it is built from — `PLUG_ITEM`, `CURATED_UPSTREAM`,
 * `FILLER_POOL`, `entity` and `Row` — come from ./fixtures, and the upstream
 * shapes they carry are the ones Investigation 3 MEASURED on 2026-08-27.
