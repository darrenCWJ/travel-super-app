/**
 * ingest-country-facts — the fixtures more than one test file reads.
 *
 * Not a `*.test.ts`: vitest.config.mts includes `scripts/**\/*.test.ts`, so
 * this file is imported by the suites and never collected as one of them.
 *
 * Every declaration below is a VERBATIM move, on 2026-09-07, of a block that
 * the 2026-09-07 split (spec 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) had left
 * duplicated byte-identically across two or three of
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts and scripts/country-facts/*.test.ts.
 * The bodies are unchanged — only `export ` was added to each declaration —
 * and every duplicate copy was deleted in favour of importing from here, so a
 * measured upstream shape now has exactly one home and cannot drift between
 * files.
 *
 * Where each block came from in `git show HEAD:scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts`:
 *
 * | Block                | Original lines | Was duplicated in                          |
 * |----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
 * | `Row`                | 62             | entry, picks.test.ts, facts.test.ts        |
 * | `PLUG_ITEM`          | 284–300        | entry, picks.test.ts, facts.test.ts        |
 * | `PLUG_ARTICLE`       | 325–329        | entry, picks.test.ts                       |
 * | `plugRows`           | 331–336        | picks.test.ts, facts.test.ts               |
 * | `entity`             | 752–753        | entry, picks/facts/curated.test.ts         |
 * | `CURATED_UPSTREAM`   | 1157–1251      | entry, curated.test.ts                     |
 * | `FILLER_POOL`        | 1615–1628      | entry, gate.test.ts                        |
 * | `SAMPLE_FILLERS`     | 1630–1634      | entry, gate.test.ts                        |
 * | `SAMPLE_GROWTH_GAIN` | 1659–1677      | entry, gate.test.ts                        |
 *
 * The upstream shapes here are the ones Investigation 3 MEASURED on
 * 2026-08-27 — `NL EUR/USD/AWG/XCG`, `FR 400/230`, `PL PLN/PLZ`, `ZW` x13,
 * `BA BAD/BAM` (2026-09-03) and Q60740126 across 39 countries — not shapes
 * invented to make a rule look reachable.
 *
 * Two inner comments still say "below" and point at their original
 * neighbours rather than at anything in this file: `PLUG_ITEM`'s "see the
 * withhold test below" is `pickPlugs`' BS 546 test in
 * scripts/country-facts/picks.test.ts, and `CURATED_UPSTREAM`'s "the
 * row-fires test below" is in scripts/country-facts/curated.test.ts. They
 * were left as written because these bodies are verbatim.
