/**
 * ingest-country-facts — the build gate, one test per branch, plus the
 * committed artifact checked against the rules as they stand today.
 *
 * Moved out of scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts on 2026-09-07 (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) when scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs was
 * split along its section banners. Every describe below is that file's,
 * unchanged; only the import paths moved with them.
 *
 * No network call is made anywhere in this file. Every upstream answer is a
 * fixture, and the artifact block below reads only the committed file.
 *
 * The `run()` block those describes' preamble points at — "Every branch is
 * also driven through the real `run()` below" — is now
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts, which still drives every branch of
 * this gate by behaviour with an injected loader.
 *
 * `FILLER_POOL`, `SAMPLE_FILLERS` and `SAMPLE_GROWTH_GAIN` come from
 * scripts/country-facts/fixtures.ts, their single home since 2026-09-07: the
 * whole-feed harness in scripts/country-facts/runHarness.ts sizes its feed
 * from the same pool, and the `run()` describes in
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.test.ts reuse the same growth slices — both
 * read them from there now rather than from a copy. `SAMPLE_DRIFT_LOSS` below
 * is this file's alone and stays here.
 *
 * The last describe, `the four withhold rules are observably live on a whole
 * feed`, joined this file on 2026-09-07 — the split's table always placed it
 * here, and it could only land once the whole-feed apparatus it is built from
 * became importable as scripts/country-facts/runHarness.ts. It calls no
 * `run()` and touches no filesystem.

/**
 * Six disjoint slices of a sample build whose fields sum to 131 — more than
 * MAX_SHRINK_RATIO's 5% of its 2,209 facts — while each field stays above its
 * own per-field coverage floor and no country loses more than one field. Sized
 * that way on purpose: the point is to reach the DRIFT check specifically,
 * rather than being stopped one gate earlier for an unrelated reason.
 *
 * Re-sized at Task 25 against the MEASURED floors, which are much tighter than
 * Task 24's provisional guesses. The headroom each slice has left is now one
 * or two countries wide for the last three fields (officialLanguages 13,
 * drivingSide 11, lat 10) — which is the arithmetic that forced
 * MAX_SHRINK_RATIO down to 0.05, because the largest loss that clears every
 * floor at once is 9.3% and a 10% threshold could never have fired.
