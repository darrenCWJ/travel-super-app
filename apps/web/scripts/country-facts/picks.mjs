 * The standard -> letter table. LANDMINE 3.
 *
 * P2853 does not return letters. It returns technical standards — `Europlug`,
 * `Schuko`, `BS 1363`, `NEMA 1-15`, `AS/NZS 3112`, `IEC 60906-1`, `SN 441011`
 * and the bare `Type E`/`H`/`K`/`L` items — and Investigation 3 measured the
 * distinct value set across all 246 countries at exactly 14 items, one of
 * which is a *Wikipedia article* (see `DROPPED_PLUG_ITEMS`). Small enough to
 * audit by hand, which is the whole reason this is a table and not a regex.
 *
 * ANY unrecognised standard withholds the WHOLE plug field for that country.
 * It is never passed through and never guessed at: "Peru uses type A/B/C
 * plugs" is checkable, and "Peru uses type IEC-60906-1 plugs" is a sentence no
 * traveller can act on.
 *
 * TWELVE rows for the thirteen standards the shipping query MEASURED on
 * 2026-08-27 by the shipping query (Task 25, not the design prototype). That
 * measurement is the whole distinct P2853 label set across
 * the 246 shard countries, counts attached:
 *
 *   Europlug 135, Schuko 75, BS 1363 55, NEMA 1-15 54, NEMA 5-15 46,
 *   Type E 40, AS/NZS 3112 21, BS 546 15, Type K 9, Type L 9, SN 441011 6,
 *   Type H 2, IEC 60906-1 2  — plus the Wikipedia article at 39
 *   (`DROPPED_PLUG_ITEMS`), which is the fourteenth distinct value.
 *
 * Two changes against Task 24's provisional table, both forced by that run.
 * `Type D` and `Type M` are GONE: upstream uses neither item, so both rows
 * were dead code that could only ever have fired on a value nobody has seen.
 *
 * `BS 546` is measured, is the thirteenth standard, and is DELIBERATELY NOT
 * GIVEN A ROW. One Wikidata item covers both of its sizes — the 5 A variant
 * is IEC type D and the 15 A variant is type M — and the statement carries
 * nothing that separates them. Guessing D would publish "South Africa uses
 * type C/D/N" when South Africa's round-pin sockets are the 15 A type M, and
 * a traveller who buys a type D adapter on that sentence finds it does not
 * fit. Measured cost of refusing instead: 15 countries withhold their plug
 * field — MO, BT, MZ, PK, IL, PS, ZA, IN, BW, LK, NP, SZ, NG, NA, LS (SZ and
 * LS carry BS 546 alone, so they would have been withheld by any rule). Those
 * countries say so, per field, through the gap note. Recorded in
 * data/country-facts-report.md's "Not derivable" section so it is not
 * re-litigated as an oversight.
 *
 * A row can only ever RECOGNISE a standard, each letter below is hand-checked
 * against IEC 60083, and a standard with no row still withholds — which is why
 * an unmappable standard costs coverage but can never cost correctness.

 *   container about a country's languages, used by GN alone. It is the only
 *   item in the universe whose class is `languages of a country` (Q55958305).
 *   Rendered by `languageTip` it reads "languages of Guinea is the official
 *   language - download an offline translation pack", which is design risk 2
 *   ("a template renders a true fact into a false sentence") in real data.
 * - `Q25167` `Bokmål` and `Q25164` `Nynorsk` — the two items in the universe
 *   whose class is `målform` (Q14860523), the Norwegian word for a WRITTEN
 *   FORM of a language. Both are written standards OF Norwegian, which Norway
 *   also lists separately, so publishing them made NO read "Bokmål, Norwegian,
 *   Nynorsk and Sámi are official languages" — a list naming one language
 *   three times. Dropped, Norway reads "Norwegian and Sámi", which is what its
 *   Language Act says.
 * - `Q2530387` `Taglish` — the only item in the universe whose class is
 *   `code-switching` (Q255615). It is the Tagalog/English register Manila
 *   speaks, not a language anybody publishes a translation pack for, and its
 *   own P37 statement is qualified `nature of statement: de facto`.
 *
 * BY CLASS WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG, and the measurement is why this is an id
 * list rather than the class filter it looks like it wants to be. `register`
 * (Q286576) sounds like exactly the right thing to exclude and it is the class

 * languages to catch three items. Only `målform`, `code-switching` and
 * `languages of a country` are clean, and between them they contain exactly
 * the four ids above.
 *
 * By id and not by label, for `DROPPED_PLUG_ITEMS`'s reason: an upstream label
 * edit must not silently re-admit one. Measured zero countries carry ONLY
 * dropped items, and - exactly as for the plug article - that assumption is
 * enforced rather than trusted: `buildFacts` records any country withheld only

 * statement carries a `P518 applies to part` qualifier — upstream saying, on
 * the statement itself, that this is NOT a claim about the whole country. The
 * United States is the case that forces it: every one of its truthy P37
 * statements is scoped to a territory (Carolinian and Chamorro to the Northern
 * Marianas, Hawaiian to Hawaii, Samoan to American Samoa, Spanish to Puerto
 * Rico), and English's is DEPRECATED rank, so an unfiltered query published
 * "Carolinian, Chamorro, Hawaiian, Samoan and Spanish are official languages —
 * download an offline translation pack before you go" about the United States.
 *
 * ANY scoped statement withholds the WHOLE field, which is `pickPlugs`'s BS 546
 * rule applied to the same kind of ambiguity, and the alternative was measured
 * before it was rejected. Dropping only the scoped statements and publishing
 * the remainder leaves AZ with `Azerbaijani Sign Language` ALONE — Azerbaijani
 * itself is the scoped one, because upstream used `applies to part` to name a
 * variety rather than a territory — and `languageTip` renders a one-item list
 * as "X is the official language". Trading a false sentence about the United
 * States for a false sentence about Azerbaijan is not a fix. Whole-field, the
 * gap note names the field and nobody is told anything untrue.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-27 across all 246 codes, the whole cost is SIX countries:
 * AF, AZ, BE, BQ, PW, US. TWO OF THE SIX ARE RESCUED BY HAND rather than left
 * withheld — see `CURATED_FACTS`' BE and AZ rows. The rule is right and its
 * answer is wrong for those two, because their P518 values name a part of the
 * country (Belgium's language regions) or a variety of the language (Standard
 * Azerbaijani) rather than a territory the national claim excludes. Telling
 * those apart means judging what the qualifier's VALUE is, which is a question
 * about sovereignty rather than a shape a picker can check, so it is answered
 * once by a human in a row that a test asserts still FIRES. The four that stay
 * withheld stay withheld. `P1001 applies to jurisdiction` is checked for by
 * name in the query comment and is used by ZERO statements in this universe,
 * so it deliberately gets no rule here — a rule that can only fire on a value
 * nobody has seen is the dead `Type D`/`Type M` row `PLUG_LETTERS` already
 * had to delete.
 *
 * Shaped like `pickPlugs`: it returns the names plus the two things a finished

 * territorially scoped, or because a dropped id was everything this country
 * had. Both are gate and report inputs, not artifact fields.
