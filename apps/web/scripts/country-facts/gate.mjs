 * 201 countries and then baseline every later run against 201.
 *
 * The two sets are RECONCILED, measured 2026-08-27 by the shipping query. The
 * app's 246 shard codes are a STRICT SUBSET of the 259 codes Wikidata carries
 * a truthy P297 for: nothing the app ships a shard for is unknown upstream,
 * and the 13 extras are AC, AN, AQ, BV, CP, CQ, DD, DG, HM, PC, TA, UM, YU.
 * `COUNTRY_CODES` bounds the query to the 246, so the answer is the
 * intersection and this band is measuring the same thing on both sides.
 *
 * The first real build returned exactly 246. The tolerance is for the handful
 * of items whose P297 Wikidata adds or retires; a code upstream stops carrying

/**
 * Per-field floors, because 246 records can all survive while one field goes
 * null everywhere — the `assertExtractQualitySane` lesson, where a healthy
 * record count hid every description being replaced by a stub.
 *
 * MEASURED, and now DERIVED rather than described. `MEASURED_FIELD_COVERAGE`
 * below is the shipping query's own post-withhold coverage OF THE COMMITTED
 * ARTIFACT, out of 246. Eight of the ten floors are written as that number
 * less `FIELD_HEADROOM`, so the arithmetic is executable and a reader
 * recomputes it rather than trusting it. The two floors written as LITERALS
 * are the two deliberate deviations, and the code shape is the tell: a literal
 * floor is a pinned judgement that must NOT follow a future measurement down.
 *
 * The table used to live in this comment as prose, and five of its numbers had
 * gone stale against the file they described — one of them promising a safety
 * margin the gate does not actually deliver. Hence it is code now. Headroom
 * for any row is `MEASURED_FIELD_COVERAGE[f] - MIN_FIELD_COVERAGE[f]`, and
 * `gate.test.ts` asserts the uniform rule, both deviations, and the exact
 * count at which the gate flips.
 *
 * Three rows moved against Task 24's provisional guesses and each is a
 * finding rather than a rounding:
 *
 * - `currencyCode` 234 -> 239. The design's prototype filtered labels to
 *   `en` only, and Q4916 (the euro) now has no English label at all — its
 *   label lives under `mul`. See `labelWithMulFallback`.
 * - `drivingSide` 245 and `lat` 246 close the design's unexplained 246 -> 245
 *   pair. Driving side is raw 246 and post-withhold 245: exactly one country,
 *   AR, carries both left and right, because Argentina drove on the left until
 *   1945. Latitude is 246 both raw and post-withhold — every country returns
 *   exactly one best-rank centroid — so the prototype's 245 was not
 *   reproducible and is not carried forward.
 * - `plugs` 222 -> 207, and its floor DROPS from 200 to 197. That is not the
 *   gate being loosened to admit bad data: the prototype's 222 assumed the
 *   standard `BS 546` maps to a letter, and it does not — one Wikidata item
 *   covers both the 5 A (type D) and 15 A (type M) sizes. Fifteen countries
 *   are withheld rather than guessed at; see `PLUG_LETTERS`. The floor tracks
 *   the measurement under the same -10 rule as every other row.
 *
 * `officialLanguages` IS PINNED AT 233 AND DOES NOT MOVE WITH ITS
 * MEASUREMENT. Task 25 measured 243. The territorial-scope rule in
 * `pickLanguages` then withheld the whole field from six countries whose only
 * P37 statements upstream itself marks as applying to part of the country —
 * and the United States one published a flat falsehood — taking the row to
 * 237. Commit 017468c gave two of those six back by hand (`CURATED_FACTS`' BE
 * and AZ rows, whose qualifiers name a language region or a language VARIETY
 * rather than a territory beside the country), so it measures 239 today and
 * the countries without the field are AF, BQ, GP, MQ, PW, US and UY — three of
 * which upstream simply has no P37 for and which never lost anything.
 *
 * Under the uniform rule this row would read 229. It stays at 233, because
 * lowering a gate to admit the fix that tripped it is how a gate becomes
 * decoration.
 *
 * THE MARGIN THAT LEAVES, STATED CORRECTLY: 239 - 233 = 6, and the gate is
 * `covered < floor`, so six countries missing the field lands exactly ON the
 * floor and the SEVENTH is what the floor itself stops. That arithmetic is
 * still true of the floor — it is no longer true of the nightly job. Since
 * this branch, `// --- Official languages, per country` below compares every
 * country's list against the previous artifact and stops the run on the
 * FIRST one that loses it, on every run that has a previous artifact — which
 * is every nightly run. So this floor no longer bounds what a night can lose
 * unnoticed: it bounds a run with nothing to compare against (a first run, or
 * an empty previous artifact), and — because it sits earlier in this function
 * than the per-country check, before `if (!previous) return;` even — it also
 * bounds a human's accepted change: seven or more withdrawn lists are refused
 * here, before the per-country check has even consulted the acceptance. Six
 * is tighter than the eight uniform rows and looser than `name`'s two, as a
 * statement about the floor alone.
 *
 * A floor that only binds a baseline-less run or an accepted change is still
 * a real choice, not a formality: RAISING it is a judgement about how thin a
 * first run's own coverage may be, and about how far a batch of reviewed
 * losses may still be let to push officialLanguages down. It belongs to a
 * human with the nightly job's history in front of them, and a floor that is
 * wrong but fails loudly beats a floor nobody chose. What is fixed here is
 * that the margin is now stated correctly for the runs it actually governs,
 * and asserted in a test, so whoever touches it next is choosing rather than
 * inheriting a false one.
 *
 * `name` is the ONE row that does not take ten countries of headroom, and the
 * deviation is deliberate rather than an oversight. Measured 246 of 246 -
 * every country answers, exactly once, with a label that is neither blank, nor
 * multi-valued, nor over the character ceiling - so the -10 rule would set a
 * floor of 236 and quietly permit ten countries to be called "PE" instead of
 * "Peru". A missing name is not a thin fact, it is a sentence that reads as
 * broken software; and unlike every field above it, `name` has no withhold
 * rule that can legitimately fire in bulk. Two countries of headroom is what
 * that leaves: enough that a single upstream label deletion does not stop the
 * world's refresh, tight enough that a systemic label failure does.
