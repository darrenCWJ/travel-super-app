/**
 * ingest-country-facts — the field lists, the property queries' shape, the
 * record build, and the demotion/carry-forward rules.
 *
 * Moved verbatim out of scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs on 2026-09-07 (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) so that file stays under the 800-line
 * guidance; every docblock below is that file's, and the build it describes
 * is unchanged. The entry point — `run`, the run guard — is still
 * scripts/ingest-country-facts.mjs.
 *
 * This is the rest of that file's `// Pure build` section, from `FACT_FIELDS`
 * down to the build gate, with one block lifted out of the middle: the
 * `CURATED_FACTS` table that sat between `buildFacts` and `applyCurated` is
 * now scripts/country-facts/curated.mjs and is imported below. The two halves
 * either side of it are joined here in their original order, unedited, so
 * `applyCurated` still reads immediately after the table's former position.
 *
 * The `EmergencyNumber`, `CountryFacts` and `Diagnostics` typedefs below are a
 * byte-identical copy of the ones that file declared before the split — it
 * keeps only `Row` now — for the reason the twin in
 * scripts/country-facts/parse.mjs gives. `CountryFacts` annotates the records
 * this module builds and cannot be written without `EmergencyNumber`.

 * would have meant loosening a calibrated gate to admit a schema change. Left
 * out, every one of those bands keeps the meaning it was measured with, and a

 * `codes` feeds no fields — it establishes the country universe, and a run
 * without it has nothing to build at all.
 *
 * `batch` is how many country codes ride in one request's `VALUES` block, and
 * every value below is derived from one measured number rather than chosen:
 * the rows-per-answering-country density the shipping query returned on
 * 2026-08-27 by the shipping query over all 246 codes.
 *
 *   name     246 rows / 246 countries = 1.00   currency 268 / 244 = 1.10
 *   plugs    508 / 222 = 2.29                  voltage  234 / 222 = 1.05

 *   coordinate 246 / 246 = 1.00
 *
 * The rule, applied uniformly: the largest size in {50, 100, 150, 200} whose
 * measured density keeps ONE request under 250 rows. That is roughly a tenth
 * of what the whole universe returns in a single request today, so upstream
 * would have to grow tenfold before any one request came near Blazegraph's own
 * 60-second ceiling — and a batch that does bail out costs a slice of one
 * property rather than the property, which is the granularity
 * `isPropertyAnswerPlausible` judges at.
 *
 * `codes` is unbatched: it is the country universe, its `VALUES` block IS the
 * batch key, and splitting the thing every other batch is cut from would be
