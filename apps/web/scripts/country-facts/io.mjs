    // this is not a claim about the whole country: every truthy P37 statement
    // the United States carries is scoped to a territory, so the `wdt:` form
    // published "Carolinian, Chamorro, Hawaiian, Samoan and Spanish are
    // official languages" about the US. `?scoped` carries that fact out to
    // `pickLanguages`, which withholds the whole field — the withhold decision
    // stays in reviewed JavaScript where the diagnostics and the gate can see
    // it, rather than disappearing into a FILTER whose effect nothing can
    // count.
    //
    // `?st a wikibase:BestRank` is the truthy filter `wdt:` would have given
    // for free, and it matters here beyond tidiness: US English is DEPRECATED
    // rank ("wrong property", disputed by the Constitution, subject of
    // Executive Order 14224), so it is absent from both forms and no rule in
    // this file may pretend otherwise.
    //
    // `P1001 applies to jurisdiction` is the other qualifier that would mean
    // the same thing. Measured 2026-08-27 across all 246 codes, it appears on
    // ZERO P37 statements, so it deliberately gets no clause — see
    // `PLUG_LETTERS` on the dead `Type D`/`Type M` rows.
    //
    // `?item` is selected as well as its label for `pickPlugs`'s reason:
    // `DROPPED_LANGUAGE_ITEMS` acts on the Q-id, so dropping Guinea's
    // "languages of Guinea" meta-item, or Norway's two written forms, survives
    // an upstream label edit while dropping them by label would not.
    //
    // Measured 2026-08-27: this form returns 451 rows over 243 countries, the
    // same as the `wdt:` form it replaces, so the batch density in
    // `PROPERTIES` is unchanged.
