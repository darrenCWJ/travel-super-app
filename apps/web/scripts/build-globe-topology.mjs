/**
 * build-globe-topology.mjs
 *
 * Builds public/world-globe.json — the coarse topology the orthographic globe
 * draws — from world-atlas 110m.
 *
 * Why a second asset at all: rotation is not an affine transform, so every
 * frame re-projects every feature, and the CSS-transform trick that makes the
 * flat map's zoom free does not apply. Measured in a production build with
 * every node mounted: 110m runs at p50 8.7ms / p95 13.1ms; the committed 50m
 * asset runs at p50 46.9ms / p95 60.6ms, or 21fps. Resolution is the binding
 * constraint, not the render target.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A COPY OF build-world-topology.mjs
 *
 * That script derives its point layer from whatever topology it is handed. Run
 * against 110m it emits 14 points instead of 76, because the 61 countries 110m
 * omits have no feature to take a centroid from — so the asset would reach 174
 * codes instead of 235, and Singapore, Malta, Hong Kong, Macau and 57 others
 * would vanish from the picker. It would not even fail loudly: the file parses
 * and renders 174 perfectly good controls.
 *
 * So the dependency runs the other way. public/world-countries.json (50m) is
 * the coverage source of truth and a build-time INPUT here; its point layer is
 * carried over, unioned with any 110m-only point, and the run aborts unless
 * polygons and points together reach every code the 50m asset draws.
 *
 * Run manually, after build-world-topology.mjs; the output is committed.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/build-globe-topology.mjs
