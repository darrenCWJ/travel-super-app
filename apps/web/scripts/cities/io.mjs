/**
 * ingest-cities — paths, sources, the retrying fetch, the writers, and the two

 *
 * Moved verbatim out of scripts/ingest-cities.mjs on 2026-09-07 (spec
 * 2026-09-07-unscheduled-items §2.1) so that file stays under the 800-line
 * guidance; every docblock below is that file's, and the build it describes
 * is unchanged. The entry point — `run`, the run guard — is still
 * scripts/ingest-cities.mjs.
 *
 * The one line that is not verbatim is `ROOT_DIR`: this file sits one
 * directory deeper than the one it came out of, so the walk up from
 * `import.meta.url` takes one more `'..'`. `USER_AGENT` has changed since, to
 * the contact form scripts/user-agent.test.ts holds every declared User-Agent
 * to (2026-09-23).
