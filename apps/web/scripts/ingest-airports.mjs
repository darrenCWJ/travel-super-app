/**
 * ingest-airports.mjs
 *
 * Builds data/airports.json (+ data/airports-report.md) from the OurAirports
 * nightly CSV: every airport with scheduled service and an IATA code.
 *
 * "International airport" is not a field OurAirports carries, and every
 * substitute is worse — `large_airport` alone drops regional airports people
 * genuinely fly to, and matching "International" in the name is
 * language-dependent. Scheduled service plus an IATA code means "an airport you
 * can buy a ticket to", which is the operative meaning for a trip planner.
 *
 * Rerunnable and idempotent: when the airport set is unchanged the previous
 * `generatedAt` is preserved, so the file is byte-identical and the daily
 * workflow has nothing to commit.
 *
 * Unlike ingest-destinations.mjs, which writes its outputs even when sanity
 * checks fail so they can be inspected, this script ABORTS before writing. A
 * corrupt airport list is not useful for inspection and would be committed and
 * deployed automatically by the workflow.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/ingest-airports.mjs
 *
 * One harmless note on that command. It reads the CSV parser straight out of
 * lib/csv.ts, relying on Node's native type stripping (stable since Node
 * 22.18 / 24) so the parser has exactly one definition, tested under
 * lib/csv.test.ts, rather than a copy here that could drift. Node prints a
 * MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON warning for that import because package.json
 * has no `"type": "module"`; the import still works and the warning is not
 * worth changing the package's module type for.
