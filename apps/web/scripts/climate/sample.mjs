/**
 * The nearest cell to a coordinate, or null when the coordinate is off the

 *
 * The `floor` is unadjusted because both rasters are PixelIsArea — see the
 * module docblock. A half-cell correction would be right for a node-registered
 * grid and is silently wrong here: it moves every city up to half a cell
 * north-west, which is nothing at 1 km and a real error near a coast on `clt`.
 *
 * The bounds check is what makes "off the raster" an answer distinct from "on
 * it" rather than an index the caller has no way to recognise as wrong. The
 * probe found 0 of 58,757 cities outside either grid, so it should never fire
 * — but +84 is a real edge on the 1 km grid and the catalog grows.
 *
 * A malformed `grid` is a different wrong from a coordinate off the raster:
 * it is the caller's bug, not a gap in the data — the same distinction
 * `tupleFor` draws when it throws on a wrong-length column instead of
 * returning null. So this throws instead of nulling when `resX`, `resY`,
 * `width` or `height` is not finite and positive, or when `originX` or
 * `originY` is not finite. The concrete case that motivates it: geotiff's
 * `getResolution()` reports `resY` NEGATIVE for a north-up raster (see the
 * `Grid` typedef above), and a grid built without correcting that sign would
 * otherwise return null for every city south of the origin — the whole
 * catalog — while every downstream shape and budget gate kept passing.
