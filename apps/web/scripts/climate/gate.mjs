 * with no cities is harmless geometry; a climate file for one is a file whose
 * every key joins to nothing, and a missing one is a country whose map renders
 * with no climate at all. Neither should be decided by a count — a run that
 * loses one country and gains another keeps the count identical.

 * An id in one file and not the other is a city that renders with no climate,
 * or a row nothing will ever read — both silent.
 *
 * `written` is an ITERABLE and not a Set on purpose, so a duplicate survives
 * long enough to be caught. The failure this is really written for is a bad
 * range in `buildShards`: the catalog is one flat array sliced per country by
 * offset and length, and an overlapping or short slice writes some city twice
 * and another not at all — with a Set on both sides, an overlap would compare
 * equal and every remaining gate would pass.
 *
 * Names at most ten of each, because a build that has lost the join has lost
 * tens of thousands and the list is the wrong thing to print.

/**
 * Every row is exactly `TUPLE_LENGTH` integers, inside the parser's own bands.
 *
 * `tupleFor` already guarantees the LENGTH for anything it returns, so that
 * half of the gate is about what happens between there and disk. A positional
 * tuple carries no field names: one short row and every index after it means
 * something else, and `JSON.parse` will accept it happily.
 *
 * The guard bands and the per-month `lo <= hi` cross-check are the same ones
 * `lib/climateShard.ts` applies at read time, restated here because this gate
 * was the weaker of the two and it is the one that runs BEFORE the first
 * write. Without them an unscaled decode — 246 shards of Singapore at 298 °C —
 * passes this build, lands on disk, and only announces itself 66 minutes later
 * when `npm test` parses the committed artifact back. `lo > hi` earns its own
 * check because both values can sit inside every band and still be wrong: it
 * is what a build that scaled `tasmin` and `tasmax` differently looks like.
 *
 * Naming the city, the block and the month costs nothing here and is the
 * difference between "a shard is wrong" and "tasmax is unscaled". This
 * changes no output: it either passes, or it stops the run before any write.
