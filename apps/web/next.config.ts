   * Scope: this block describes the FIRST rule below only — the committed
   * topology assets. Every rule after it carries its own docblock and its own
   * window; this note deliberately does not enumerate them, because a list
   * maintained by hand here is wrong the moment a rule is added below.
   *
   * The committed topology assets, which Next otherwise serves with
   * `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0` — it cannot know that a given file under
   * `public/` is safe to cache. These are: each changes only when its build
   * script is deliberately re-run and the result committed, and the globe asset
   * is fetched on every picker open.
   *
   * `country-projections.json` joins them for the same reason and with the same
   * lifecycle: `scripts/build-projections.mjs` is run by hand and its 20 KB
   * output committed, and PR4 reads it on every map open. It belongs in THIS
   * rule rather than a subtree rule of its own because it really is a single
   * path segment — the thing `/provinces/` and `/cities/` each needed their own
   * rule for is that they are not.
   *
   * A day, then a week of stale-while-revalidate, so a rebuild reaches users
   * within a day without any picker open paying for a revalidation.
   *
   * BEFORE ANY SCHEMA-BREAKING REBUILD OF THESE ASSETS, ship a cache bust first
   * — a hashed filename or a query string. These URLs carry no content hash, so
   * a client can hold yesterday's bytes for up to a day while newly deployed code
   * ships instantly and expects the new shape. A pure data refresh is fine: the
   * parsers throw loudly rather than degrade. A shape change is not, and the
   * picker's own "Try again" would re-request the same cached copy.
   *
   * Note the wall interacts with this: `proxy.ts` puts everything under `public/`
   * behind the login redirect, and that redirect is `no-store` precisely so a
   * signed-out request cannot park a day-long cached bounce in front of the asset.
