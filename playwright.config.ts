/**
 * The repo's first end-to-end tests, and the reason they exist.
 *
 * Every test in this project before now ran in jsdom, which parses HTML and
 * computes NO layout: `getBoundingClientRect` is all zeroes there, and CSS
 * variables like `--tap-min` are strings nothing resolves. So the phase's
 * accessibility criterion — WCAG 2.2 AA 2.5.8, a 44x44 CSS px target — was
 * asserted as viewBox arithmetic against a number the test itself computed.
 * That arithmetic was right, and it was never once checked against a browser.
 *
 * These specs measure the rendered box instead. They are deliberately few:
 * the value is in the things jsdom structurally cannot answer — real layout,
 * real CSS, a real navigation through the login wall — and not in restating
 * what 2,368 unit tests already hold.
 *
 * Port 3100 rather than 3000, and pinned rather than `autoPort`: `baseURL` has
 * to be known before the server starts, and 3000 is the port a developer is
 * most likely to already be using.

/**
 * A throwaway SQLite file, so a run never touches `data/app.db`.
 *
 * `lib/server/db.ts` reads `CIP_DB_PATH` and creates its schema on open, so
 * pointing it at an empty directory is the whole of the setup — trips and
 * Better Auth's own `user`/`session`/`account` tables all follow it.

/**
 * The checkouts nested inside this one, under `.claude/worktrees/<name>/`.
 *
 * Anchored at this file's own directory because Playwright matches
 * `testIgnore` against each file's ABSOLUTE path. The unanchored `.claude`
 * glob this replaces also matched every spec of a checkout that itself lives
 * under `.claude/worktrees/`, so `npx playwright test` there found no tests.
 *
 * Collection only walks `testDir`, so while that is `./e2e` a nested checkout
 * is out of reach regardless; this keeps it out if `testDir` ever widens, as
 * long as Playwright is started from the checkout's real path. Node resolves
 * `__dirname` through junctions and symlinks, while Playwright keeps the path
 * it was given, so re-check `--list` from the path you use if you widen it.
 *
 * A RegExp rather than a glob built from the path, which would read a `[` or
 * `{` in it as syntax. On Windows Playwright also tests RegExps against a
 * `/`-separated copy of the path, hence `/` here, and `i` because paths there
 * ignore case. `__dirname` exists because the repo is CommonJS. Escaped by
 * hand because `RegExp.escape` needs Node 24 and nothing else here does.
